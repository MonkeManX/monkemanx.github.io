## 1. Nitszce Antichrist

## 2. Paul Tillich's Ultimate Concern

## 3. A union between Nietszche and Tillich

## 4. Literal or Symbol

## 5. Conclusion

We talked about how Paul Tillich ultimate concern is very or even refers to the same thing as what Nietzsche describes in his mixture of Apolloian and disyonian elements in art such as Greek theatre. We also talked about how in his book antichrist Nitzsche bashes Christianity so hard because it's a fiction the "nothing is made holy". For Paul Tillich this is the same as idolastrious faith which he calls a faith where the ultimate concern is nothing infinite but something finite e.g. for nationalism it's the nation. So Tillich and Nitzsche agree more than one thinks, the difference is in their believe if Christianity is idalstirius or not, Nitzsche thinks so Tillich Not. Particular Nitzsche blame Paulus and the other apostle because they moved away from Jesus very grounded and focused on this live, to a much higher ecclesiastical less grounded with more metaphysical stuff and through that Nitzsche thinks a lot of nothing is made holy. Tillich talks a lot about how statis faith that relies on literalism dies, because true faith can only rely on symbolism, because only symbolism can approach the infinite. What if the difference between Nitzsche and Tillich is that Nitzsche understood Paulus metaphysical statement as statement of fact, while Tillich Takes them more symbolic? There is one more point of contention in the last chapter of the book antichrist Nitzsche gives 7 rules against Christianity, one of them is that the more liberal believer should be persecuted more than than the literalist believer. This is in conflict with what I said previously.

The debate hence becomes if Christianity should/can be understood symbolic or not. The first thing that could be argued about is the intent of the writer of the Bible, the argument would be that there are different genres and some such as the vengeloliums are meant literal, this is what Nitzsche could argue. A counter to this would be to say, it doesn't matter how it was intended. Prophet can be understood as people that have special insight in the nature of the world, and because for the people at the time it made most sense cultural and social in their framework this special insight appears in froms of God and so on.
