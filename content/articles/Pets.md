Recently, I had the idea to make a list of all the important animals and pets that my family has had. I’m not sure why I felt the impulse to do it; I guess it’s a form of remembrance.


# Pets and Animals

## Doggo Balu   

**Name:** Balu  
**Species:** Dog  
**Notes:**  
This was the dog of my mother and grandparents. I don’t know much about the dog, as it passed away when I was very young.

## First Group of Chickens

**Name:** /    
**Species:** Chicken  
**Notes:**  
I live in a small village. From time to time, a traveling chicken salesman comes to our village; this is where my family bought them.

## Bee's

**Name:** /  
**Species:** Bees    
**Notes:**   
My father is a beekeeper; he does it as a hobby but also sells the honey to friends and acquaintances. The honey is very yummy. Twice a year, you can extract the honey by putting the honeycombs in a centrifuge, which slings the honey out of the comb, and it can then be collected.

## Flocke

**Name:** Flocke  
**Species:** Cat   
**Notes:**  
Our first family cat was named 'Flocke,' which is German and means 'flake,' like a snowflake in English. The cat lived to be very old, almost 20 years. Flocke wasn’t very trusting of me; she was a bit grumpy and slept all day. Though, I can understand the trust issues, because when I was a child, I pulled the cat by its tail from beneath a wardrobe.

## Luna

**Name:** Luna   
**Species:** Dog   
**Notes:**  
Luna, which is Latin for 'Moon,' was a Labrador. We went on many adventures with her, whether we were hiking or traveling. Just like the cat, Luna became a bit grumpier as she got older. Luna loved to eat; if there was any food on the ground, she would scarf it down as if there were no tomorrow.

## Lumithai

**Name:** Lumithai  
**Species:** Cat  
**Notes:**  
This is the cat my older sister wanted. I always called the cat 'Dummi,' meaning 'dumb' in English, both to tease my sister and because the cat's name was too long. This cat was so trusting that you could almost do anything with him, and he wouldn’t care. Lumi also loved to go on walks with Luna. Sadly, the cat died too young, just a little over 10 years old.

## Later Group of Chickens

**Name:** /   
**Species:** Chicken    
**Notes:**    
My mom wanted chickens again. This time, the chickens weren’t bought as chicks. Instead, my mom used a machine and some purchased eggs to hatch them.

## Cosmo

**Name:** /  
**Species:** Dog   
**Notes:**  
Our new dog. The name 'Cosmo' comes from 'cosmonaut,' referring to Russian astronauts. The dog is a stray that was rescued in Romania. Cosmos is a nervous and anxious dog, probably due to his time on the streets.
