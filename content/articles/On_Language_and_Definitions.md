i think its philsophicals impossible to croerectnly deifne thng quesiton like what is a women ,what is morliaty, what is identiy, all depend on what is meant when someone says that and than the defintion is already baked into the question. why is tha tteh case? becuas emanign of wors is usage, and usage is a constant negtotion bewteen participiants in thel anguage of hwta something is supposed to mean. that doesnt mena defineiton are useless or that we cannot use them, sometiems it makes sense to look at deifntion of things to see somethign udner a new light ro to epxlai ncertain phenomen, but we always need to keep in midn we are not argueing here about the true defintion of an object, but soem kidn of model where we want to highlight a certain aspect of it. Thus hwen i would argue that morlait is not real, i would first aks my opponen what does he mena hwen he says morlaity and then i would show tha twhatever he means does not eixst. But een sayign stuff liek mroaliyt does not eist, does not strcityl make sense, because of what morlaity is is unclear.
