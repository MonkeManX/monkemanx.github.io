The software I have showcased in this Homelab series is just a fraction of the applications that you can host yourself on your server.

In this post, I would like to share some additional intriguing software that I plan to explore in the future, or that are generally cool projects:
- [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/): A media software system that allows you to manage movies, TV shows, and music, and stream them to various devices.
- Radarr/Sonarr/Readarr/Lidarr/Bazaar: These are movie, TV show, book, music, and subtitle torrent finder that enable you to search for torrents of your favorite media. When combined with BitTorrent, they can download the media and place it in your Jellyfin media library.
- [Jellyseer](https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr):  This tool can be used with Jellyfin and the "arr" services to request and download media
- [Paperless-Ngx](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx): A document management software that transforms all your physical documents into a searchable online archive, eliminating the need for physical paperwork.
- [Immich](https://immich.app/)A self-hosted photo and video manager and backup solution for your photos, offering an impressive set of features rivaling apps like Google Photos.
- [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/): A network wide ad-blocker. It eliminates the need to install an ad-blocker on each device, allowing you to block ads for all your devices with just one software. It can also serve as your own DNS server.
- [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/offline/quick_start_guide.html): : Similar to GitHub, GitLab allows you to host your own Git projects online and share them with others.
- [EmulatorJS](https://github.com/EmulatorJS/EmulatorJS): Enables playing retro games over a web browser from anywhere, as long as you have an internet connection.
- [Invidious](https://invidious.io/): An open-source alternative frontend for YouTube that allows you to download videos and manage them.
- [mealie](https://github.com/mealie-recipes/mealie): A self-hosted recipe manager and meal planner.
- [audiobookshelf](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf): A self-hosted audiobook and podcast server.

I hope you discover one or two interesting software applications from this list!
