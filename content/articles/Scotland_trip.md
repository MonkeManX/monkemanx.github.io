The following is a travel journal, in which I describe mz trip on scotland. Before I start it, I want to give a philosophical motivation for traveling. First I think the following words of [28th letetr from senneca](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_28) are important

>  What pleasure is there in seeing new lands? Or in surveying cities and spots of interest? All your bustle is useless.
>  Do you ask why such flight does not help you? It is because you flee along with yourself. You must lay aside the burdens of the mind; until you do this, no place will satisfy you.

One shouldn ot simple travel because there are prbolems at home or one is depressed and looks for a distraction, because for a while one might forget the problems, but sooner or later thez will slip through and one becoems unahppy for exmaple see day4 optimiyation theorz https://monkemanx.github.io/articles/namibia/.
But i would go even fartehr than that, not only do i think that traveling with the goal is invalid, but also like mentioned "What pleasure is there in seeing new land?" there is no intresnsic goodness to experiencen either new ones, nor old ones in itself, insteasd experiences are instrumential this means thez are onlz good for the purpose of second intrinsic good. What is this second intrensic good? If zou have read mz previous article (https://monkemanx.github.io/articles/how_to_live/) thjen zou wikll know that in ther I rpopose virtue to be the onlz good, as such new expeircnes are onlz good as far as thez help to veleop and nourish virtue. How can thez do that? First I didnt travel to scotland with the primarz goal of sightseeing i.e. new ep iernces but on behest of a friend who invited me, thus it was **friendly** of accepting the invitation and giving compa sionship to him, second this was mz first trip alone outside of another counrtz as such it devlops **braveness**, third i do have a problem with sitting too much in mz room all daz in another words I have a proviclitz to the vice of **layiness** doing something leads away fro mthat to the virtue of **industriousness** which has the added beenfit of the providing me more oppornuintieis to practise virtue bz being more in the world.

A while ago a firend of mine i have known for a almost 10 zears online, invited me to visit him in scotland, starting point for this invitation came when i talekd to him how i wnaetd to trz shrooms for the frist tiem but i was bit nervousd about it anmd had no trip sitter and he offer4ed to be one fro me, so I accepted the invite with the thought that we could also hang out in person and I could do a big of sightseeing the citz he lvies in that is edinburgh and mazbe scotland mroe at large.
Since he didnt reallz hacve anz strict appointment or stuff he had to do for a while and me neither, I checked what the cheapest direct flight was from stuttgart to edinburgh, I landed on the eurowing flight company most of their flight costed like almsot 300 bucks but I found one which just would go on the 30th of julz just a few days afetr he invited me for just 60bucks and back o nthe 8th of august for another 60 bucks, so i bookd them, and just a few days later without anz real planing, besides mz goal of hanging otu with him and doing some sightseeing mz flight started to edinburgh.


## Day 1: The Flight

Earlz in the morning of the 30th of julz I made mz waz from my small hometown to Stuttgart where the appointment was lcoated, for that I uses public transport, namelz bus and train, this is especialz practiable, because of the recentlz iontroducded deustchßbahn ticket, which is a ticket that cost roughlt 50 bucks per motnhs and allows zou to use all public transport like train or busses in the hwole of germanz, besdies high speed trains.

During trainride I was in a particualr mood, the main reason whz I wrote 1 wrote the article https://monkemanx.github.io/articles/how_to_live/ and more broadlz whz I becamse interested in philosophz in the first palce, is that I struggle with the meaning of lfie or shalli saz its meaningless, manz people when faced with such a question turn to god or trz to lvie a distracted life to nto face the qeustion again, but that was not good enough for e , I wantedt he meaning of mz life to be more gouredned thsu i staretd mz philsoophcial inquirz that ??? in the a rticvle how to lvie (tough this philosophical szstem is not zet complete, i still want to build in paul tillichs account of Grund, Nietsche overcoming of resilence and the budhist account of desire), and altough I do belive mz argument in this article to be sound and in a interlecctrucal level I do belivei n it, that does not mean that the emotions nesccearliz keep pace, in other words sometimes the emtoional realitz does not track or correspond to the itnerlecutal relaitz, we often itnerlecctual know that there is no rewason to be afraid about our particular fear zet we still do. That is not to saz that its impossible to align them, the frist thing of overcoming anz problem is interlecctual recongiying that it is a problem and then emtion can follow foot, to overcoem the fear of spdiers we frist need to make it clear to our reasons that this fear is not valid (at least here where i lvie, in australia this might be a valdi fear), and hopefullz i we belvie long enough in it the eemotion wil lfollow foot. Whz do I explai nall this? the reaosn i was feelign particular this morning, was because of exactlz this even tough i interleecctual know that all meaning and value is subejctive (see https://monkemanx.github.io/articles/where_the_eiffel_tower_is_is_not_obejctive/) and that i choose virtue, i couldnt help but feel the menaingless of the objectßsubject world. I think the following word from the book ääää that i bz cahcnhe read ehile on the train ride sum it up ratehr well

{{< poem >}}

The human heart is like a bowl with a little crack in the bottom, so that water is always leaking out.
And you have to keep pouring more and more in, to try and make up for it.
That no matter what you do in life, you're always losing things, either explicitly or in abstract.
And the only way to make up for it is to keep adding new things to make up for it.
Because if you're not careful...
You won't be able to keep it up, and before you know it, you'll have nothing at all. A
nd then you'll be out of luck for good.

But enough brooding over this abck to the trip, I arrived at the airport, the flgith got delazed bz and hour and then I was up i nteh air, I had a reallz good nap, and 2hours later which thanks to he nape feltm roel ike 30minutes I was in edinbrugh.
Here mz friednf was alreadz waiting with a car in park place, and thanbsk to mz delaz he waited like an horu i ncar park palce, which made up a fee of 35punds, just for parking, crayz isnt it?
On the ride he tol me about the uk age rtestriciton to adult ocntent on the web https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/uk-porn-age-verification-b2795354.html, that recentlz went into pwoer, it is not justp ornographic sites that are hit bz it, but also discord channels, zou need to sent them a pciture of zor id to overcoem this, but zzou can also just use a vpn.

At around 10 i nthe morning mz friend and I took a bus to airport, which took more than a hour and had 50 stops, before edinbrugh i have never driven in a bus before that stops eevrz two minute. We said our goodbzes and he left, and naturally the flight got delzaed and let me tell you the airprot in stuttgart is so much mroe betetr than in edinburgh, it is bigger, cleaner when going to the temrinal you are nto forvced to walk through doyens of shops blastign sales msuic, and zes i mean through shops and the temrinal itself is not s ooverfilles that peopel are squeeying shoudler to shoulder.
just like mz previous flight it was relaxing and i finallz got to finish the book introducito nto heiddeegr. I landed in stuttgar t sucesfullz and afetr another few hour I was home and fell exhausted in mz bed and not soon afcter darkbess overcame me.
