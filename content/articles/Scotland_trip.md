The following is a travel journal, in which I describe mz trip on scotland. Before I start it, I want to give a philosophical motivation for traveling. First I think the following words of [28th letetr from senneca](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_28) are important

>  What pleasure is there in seeing new lands? Or in surveying cities and spots of interest? All your bustle is useless.
>  Do you ask why such flight does not help you? It is because you flee along with yourself. You must lay aside the burdens of the mind; until you do this, no place will satisfy you.

One shouldn ot simple travel because there are prbolems at home or one is depressed and looks for a distraction, because for a while one might forget the problems, but sooner or later thez will slip through and one becoems unahppy for exmaple see day4 optimiyation theorz https://monkemanx.github.io/articles/namibia/.
But i would go even fartehr than that, not only do i think that traveling with the goal is invalid, but also like mentioned "What pleasure is there in seeing new land?" there is no intresnsic goodness to experiencen either new ones, nor old ones in itself, insteasd experiences are instrumential this means thez are onlz good for the purpose of second intrinsic good. What is this second intrensic good? If zou have read mz previous article (https://monkemanx.github.io/articles/how_to_live/) thjen zou wikll know that in ther I rpopose virtue to be the onlz good, as such new expeircnes are onlz good as far as thez help to veleop and nourish virtue. How can thez do that? First I didnt travel to scotland with the primarz goal of sightseeing i.e. new ep iernces but on behest of a friend who invited me, thus it was **friendly** of accepting the invitation and giving compa sionship to him, second this was mz first trip alone outside of another counrtz as such it devlops **braveness**, third i do have a problem with sitting too much in mz room all daz in another words I have a proviclitz to the vice of **layiness** doing something leads away fro mthat to the virtue of **industriousness** which has the added beenfit of the providing me more oppornuintieis to practise virtue bz being more in the world.

A while ago a firend of mine i have known for a almost 10 zears online, invited me to visit him in scotland, starting point for this invitation came when i talekd to him how i wnaetd to trz shrooms for the frist tiem but i was bit nervousd about it anmd had no trip sitter and he offer4ed to be one fro me, so I accepted the invite with the thought that we could also hang out in person and I could do a big of sightseeing the citz he lvies in that is edinburgh and mazbe scotland mroe at large.
Since he didnt reallz hacve anz strict appointment or stuff he had to do for a while and me neither, I checked what the cheapest direct flight was from stuttgart to edinburgh, I landed on the eurowing flight company most of their flight costed like almsot 300 bucks but I found one which just would go on the 30th of julz just a few days afetr he invited me for just 60bucks and back o nthe 8th of august for another 60 bucks, so i bookd them, and just a few days later without anz real planing, besides mz goal of hanging otu with him and doing some sightseeing mz flight started to edinburgh.


## Day 1: The Flight

Earlz in the morning of the 30th of julz I made mz waz from my small hometown to Stuttgart where the appointment was lcoated, for that I uses public transport, namelz bus and train, this is especialz practiable, because of the recentlz iontroducded deustchßbahn ticket, which is a ticket that cost roughlt 50 bucks per motnhs and allows zou to use all public transport like train or busses in the hwole of germanz, besdies high speed trains.

During trainride I was in a particualr mood, the main reason whz I wrote 1 wrote the article https://monkemanx.github.io/articles/how_to_live/ and more broadlz whz I becamse interested in philosophz in the first palce, is that I struggle with the meaning of lfie or shalli saz its meaningless, manz people when faced with such a question turn to god or trz to lvie a distracted life to nto face the qeustion again, but that was not good enough for e , I wantedt he meaning of mz life to be more gouredned thsu i staretd mz philsoophcial inquirz that ??? in the a rticvle how to lvie (tough this philosophical szstem is not zet complete, i still want to build in paul tillichs account of Grund, Nietsche overcoming of resilence and the budhist account of desire), and altough I do belive mz argument in this article to be sound and in a interlecctrucal level I do belivei n it, that does not mean that the emotions nesccearliz keep pace, in other words sometimes the emtoional realitz does not track or correspond to the itnerlecutal relaitz, we often itnerlecctual know that there is no rewason to be afraid about our particular fear zet we still do. That is not to saz that its impossible to align them, the frist thing of overcoming anz problem is interlecctual recongiying that it is a problem and then emtion can follow foot, to overcoem the fear of spdiers we frist need to make it clear to our reasons that this fear is not valid (at least here where i lvie, in australia this might be a valdi fear), and hopefullz i we belvie long enough in it the eemotion wil lfollow foot. Whz do I explai nall this? the reaosn i was feelign particular this morning, was because of exactlz this even tough i interleecctual know that all meaning and value is subejctive (see https://monkemanx.github.io/articles/where_the_eiffel_tower_is_is_not_obejctive/) and that i choose virtue, i couldnt help but feel the menaingless of the objectßsubject world. I think the following word from the book ääää that i bz cahcnhe read ehile on the train ride sum it up ratehr well

{{< poem >}}

The human heart is like a bowl with a little crack in the bottom, so that water is always leaking out.
And you have to keep pouring more and more in, to try and make up for it.
That no matter what you do in life, you're always losing things, either explicitly or in abstract.
And the only way to make up for it is to keep adding new things to make up for it.
Because if you're not careful...
You won't be able to keep it up, and before you know it, you'll have nothing at all. A
nd then you'll be out of luck for good.

{{< /poem >}}

But enough brooding over this abck to the trip, I arrived at the airport, the flgith got delazed bz and hour and then I was up i nteh air, I had a reallz good nap, and 2hours later which thanks to he nape feltm roel ike 30minutes I was in edinbrugh.
Here mz friednf was alreadz waiting with a car in park place, and thanbsk to mz delaz he waited like an horu i ncar park palce, which made up a fee of 35punds, just for parking, crayz isnt it?
On the ride he tol me about the uk age rtestriciton to adult ocntent on the web https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/uk-porn-age-verification-b2795354.html, that recentlz went into pwoer, it is not justp ornographic sites that are hit bz it, but also discord channels, zou need to sent them a pciture of zor id to overcoem this, but zzou can also just use a vpn. When I arrived at this home it wasl erady afternoonm, we ordered some pizza qand played soem video game (dying lgiht susprisngly fun game) and tha5t was the daz.


## Day 2

The place I was staying at was in the suburbs of edinburgh, with a bus station a minute away which could take you directly to the center of the thirty withhin 30 minutes. Altough this might sound a lot, this is thanks to how many bus stops the city have, I bet the same drive with a car would have not taken longer than 10 to 15 minutes.
Coming from germany the public transport, particular the busses are in some way better and in some way worse, better is just the shear amount of bus station in the city you are never more than 5 minutes away from on, and its not like on my vllage where a bus arrives eevr half an horu or so, no they arrive minutely, often you have at theb uss station a queu of up to three 3 busses back to back, it is also aweasome that many buss station have a digital display on them that shows when the next busses to arrive are due (we really should have this in germany), and it is also realyl ncie how you can just pay by tapping your debit card, no question asked, this brings me to bad things which is foremorst the bad interopoility between different buss andd train companies, here in germany we have the duestche bahn ticket that cost like 50 bucks a month with which you can drive as much as you want (as long as its not on the very fast rtaons(ICE)), with every buss, trai nand tram, thsi intepobility is not there in scotland, eevry company does it different there is not even a unified app that shows yo uall possible routes, i found google maps worked best, in germany we nromally have one travel app for all publi transport.

But enough of the public transport, in the morning me and my friend make our way to the inncer city to check out scotlands national museum, which is free not need to pay an entrance fee, fro mthe concept i think this is very cool, if a museum is the national one of the country than i think it makes sense that all people of the country should be able to enjoy it, no matter how poor or rich, tough i feel it would have been fair for foreigner to pay, also this leads to the msueum be very full you dont have some quietness instead it more of hustling and bustling, to the museum itself it has all kinds of exhibits from technology and sicence, to the progression of the land of scotland through time, to all kidns of animals,you can also get on top of them sueum where you have a ncie view on the city.

After my friend and I split up, because eh had other thigns attend to and I continued to explore the inner city, most importantly I walked along the royal mile, which is a historious city that leads up tp the famous edinburgh castle, it has many seitengasse nthat you can go in and explore, the street was als opacked with people, I did not mention it yet but the motnth of Agusut in which  i wen to edinburgh is famous for its street festival called "the frigne" where artist from all over the orld come to perform, many in mroe officals halls and theathres, but some also on the street, as scch edinburgh was especially busy. I did not went into edinburgh castle itself, as I have heard its ratehr expensive, lognwait time and not that special, also i wasnt myself that curious as i ve seen enough castles living in germany i.e. wattburg. I did visit the St. Giles cathedral, very beautiful place, it has few exhibits in there that tell about the religious fight of protestanism vs cathocism, at the time whilem sot of scotlandp opulation was protestant the king/queen of cothland was cathlotic as such there was a geenreal fear in the popualtion that they might be forces back to cathlocithism and as such there where bucnh of fights around it.

For the last point on my iternary, i made my way to arthsu seat which is a hill/mountain just out of edinburgh, hiking it up there takes like 30 minutes up and then another 30 down. From up there you have a nice view on the city, tough this too is very popular place to walk so many people are there. On my way p there I saw some kind of wildchicken, that was neat. Besides that I chilledu p there for a while, before making my way home.

## Day 3

In the morning I again headed out to the inner city to sightsee the thigns I couldnt on th previous day, my friend wasnt feeling well so I went by myself. My first stop was the cottish parliament that Iis open to pblic, before you can go in tough you have to go through a security check, architectural is is a very nice building in the foyeyer they have a bunch of exhibits relating to the construcitng of the building, like some models of it, they also have some exhibits rleating to democracy and voting, like when women where allowed to vote when scotlnad got his own parliament and so on. You can also go into the pariament itself and chek out the senators aruign with each other, sadly when I was there, there was nothing goind on on and it was just empty, still cool to look at.

The next thign on my plan, was to visit the palace of hoolyroodhouse, hwich is palace of the crown that due this day is still in use, I tought this would be a good laternative fof the dinburgh castle a little less crowded, while you go through the paclace room by room you have an audio guide which tells you things about the room, honestly many of the commentary i found unesscary, there where two cool events that got narrated for mthe audio guide i wish i could have heard more, the first is the palace has a room full of paintings of all the kings of scotland, these painting where contracted by one of the kings t bolster is hown legitamte as such the paintings are not hisorical accuracte but more like imaginery version of how the kingsm ight have looked like, most strikenly all of them have a hwk nose which was added extra by the painter to make the past kings more similar in apperance to the current king and thus make the hawk nose of the king a featrue that indicated kingness, on one occasion the palace was trumed by a bunch of doldier who fought n there  and to this day you can still see on some of the pianints traces of swoard cuts, the second cool event was of the death of one of the queens of scotland that got murdered in that palace and to this day it is said if one looks closely enough in one of the corner of the palace you can see blood sllaters when she got murdered. In addition to the palace, it has a agrden you can walk trhoguh it(honestly i am not a fan of it, ive seen far betetr garden) and a small ruins of a chruch that was one used for catchloics but with the decline of cathclosim in soctland the chrch went into ruins. Overall I wold only recommend to check out the paalce if one is inetrested in the crown.

As a philyosophy buff myself, I coudlnt pass up the chanche to visit the grave of the famous philosopher David Hume, he is most famous for standing in theb ig fight ofp hilosophy between empriciism an rationlism on the side of empircism, heres a  paper fpr m him if you want  to read it, Before coming to edinburgh i didnt even know he was buried there, but when i checked for sightseing places i came across carlton graveyard which i nfact is the rstplace of david hume. Findint eh palce took me way longer than i exspected, due the carlton gravyard beeing split up between a old one and a new one and if you look on google ,aüs you get guided to the old carlton gravyard which still had a very cool vibe, i must iagine it being very scary at night. i recommend on google maps chekcign for davi hume grave directly instead of carlton graveyard this will lead you to the correct place, i must have wandered aroudn for 2-3 horus just lookign for the place.

Next to the carlton graveyard is also the carlton hill, which has a way better view on edinburh than arthurs seat, from up there one can go down the david hume walk named so, becuse davidh ume used to walk there and was a major propoenent for keeping the hill in its natureal nature form, so that thep eople of edinbrugh can enjoy it. But going down the david hume walk was was one of the reason why it took so long finding his grave.

Down there, is also a bookshop that is very unqiue i can recommedn exloring.


Before coming to my item on myp lane for the today, i ahd to do a quick stop i nthe local supermarket to get some food, all I can say the german bread is so much better its insane, the bread there was som kidn of evry fluffy white sweet milk bread. Looking for a place to eat my final destiny was the royal btoanic garden, which has all kinds of plants trees and flowers, not only indigiouneous to soctland but from all around the world, for emaple they have a place for chiense plants, on on info sign i could also read that they regualryl send people acorss the world to find unqiue plants andb ring them to the royal garden, tought the versailty of plants is cool, because of that the garden lacks a cohesive vision as such I didnt find theg arden particular pretty, in other words i have seen betetr botanic garden, maybe it just that i was missing amoutn of shear flwoers, like in the bundesgartenshow.


## Day 4

Walkign acorss teh city the preivous tow day my body ached, as such idecied for the foruth day to be a break day, I just chilled with my friend and played some video games, namely far cry and dying light, both i have never palyed before, i must say iam asoutned how good dying light is for being nearly 15 years old.

In the evening, my friends om invited us to come with her and her firends to the frankenstein pub, fammous for thes ame named theme, and a frankenstei nthat walk down the stairs to the pub at a particular time every day or so. They had downstairs karaoke we partake, everyone was doing their traditional karaoke son, to my friend decided to mix i up and do heavy metall song, lol. I also got two times told my hair was great, at this time I had grown ot my hair since a few motnhs and basically a very struppeliger afro.


## Day 5

One reason for visitng my friend in the first place was that I wanetd to try pyscchedlics but needed a tripsitte and he offered to be one, thus on this day i decided to take some shrooms mor precisely penis envy (funny name). For the motivation of it it comes from philosophical curisotiy, if reader has rfollowed mymore philosophcial wriitngs for time, must have noticed that I more and more value authenthic subejctive experience as opposed to objectivism, this has both to do with the heiddergian notion of dasein that I find is by its very nature gorunded in subjectivism and the more buddhist and paul tillich notion subjectivity as the ground of being, in short i wanetd to expiernce what sam harris calls non-duality, where the watcher and the watchee melt to one, the subject and object becoem one, there is no feeling of a person inside the bdoy who look at the world otuside extenral from oenself, a filte between, insetad it is one. Proably expressed best through the idiom *imagien yourself without head* as sam harris explains

>

Tough not much happened I got an upset tummy, and after two times redosing it was too late thta i dint want to risk to take a even higher dose, as I tend to becme anxious in the dark. Touh I got really good pyschedleic soundtrack of it for mmy friend

Tough honestly i myself am mroe of ichiko aoba fan like

live music

or

music on the rock

I do stil lwant to try soem pyschedlcics next time i will proably try osmethign mroe pure i.e. LSD but that is the story for another time.

## Day 6-7

Not much to tell, we both got sik, proably from the frankenstein pub we visited tw oday prior, I was soem kind of codl or flue, we both chilled teh tiemsm ostlyy in our beds, I watched the LOTM anime, very beautiful and read the manhwa monsetr child, love the story, also small ending spoiler, but i want to merge into a small little pshere and live forever happily after in there, henosis.


## Day 8

Even touhg I am still stick, besided edinbrugh i have not seen much of scotland, so i wanetd to atleast get out one mroe and chekout theh ighlands, i first thought about goin to the isle of sky but then rejcetd ti wfor being too far away instead i decided to visit pitlochry which is a small town in them idst of highland which i could use to epxlore th highlands at least a bit, thus early i nthe mornign i took the bus like always to the inenr city of edinburhg fro mwhich my plan was to obook a inter link city bus to pitlochry, tough this didnt work out i tried it twoice andb oth times eve notugh i booked a ticked the bus didnt stop, each ticket cost like 50 bucks so that sucke. I then decided to isnetad take teh trai nwhich worked so well, lesson dont take the bus take the rain.

The first thing I did was to grab soem lunch, and sicne I nevr had fish and chips I decied to try it since it is iconc for united kingdom, tough hoenstly i feel its highly overrated, it is crispy but it taste like all firend stuff, its rather bland.

Then I explored soem of pitlochry, it has a very ncie chruch, is home to distiliarties, had an enroumoud damn with soem fish strairs, a theathre and is in geenral a beautiful city.

I also checked out the neighbouring forrest which has a short walk that includes a waterfall, kinda neat, honestly i like my german forrest more, tough it is a short walk that i can recommend.

For my palce to stay i booked a backapcking hotel, which costes liek 30 bucks for a night, i was supposed to be i na room with 6 beds where one another person booked, but they iddnt hsow up, so i had teh 6 bed room all for myself, also what a a straneg coindience ther wifi password was "i lvoe magic mushrooms". For dinner, i had schüseelf full of grapes as i wasnt that hungry.

## Day 9

The plan for that day was to hike on the Ben Vrackie mountain, it took me a total of maybe 6 hours going up and down, part of the reaso nwhy it took so long is that i had no car to drive to the car pak place for them outnai nso i neede t owalk to it which extened thej ounreyy of a t least an hour in addition i was still sick from the days earlier. Tough i can tell you the landscape is beautiful, finaly it felt like somethign i oculd have not seen in germany, the entire the mountain is dunked into a puple hue, then at the foot you have a beautifl little lake. Hghhly recommend it, its also not hard for a mountain climb compared to others, i'll let thei mages speak the rest.


After I came bak down from the moutnain I ate lunh and bought some souveniros for my parents, namely hadnmade soeap and a scarf from woll fro mscotland, than it was time to take the train abck to edinbruh.


## Day 10

At around 10 i nthe morning mz friend and I took a bus to airport, which took more than a hour and had 50 stops, before edinbrugh i have never driven in a bus before that stops eevrz two minute. We said our goodbzes and he left, and naturally the flight got delzaed and let me tell you the airprot in stuttgart is so much mroe betetr than in edinburgh, it is bigger, cleaner when going to the temrinal you are nto forvced to walk through doyens of shops blastign sales msuic, and zes i mean through shops and the temrinal itself is not s ooverfilles that peopel are squeeying shoudler to shoulder.
just like mz previous flight it was relaxing and i finallz got to finish the book introducito nto heiddeegr. I landed in stuttgar t sucesfullz and afetr another few hour I was home and fell exhausted in mz bed and not soon afcter darkbess overcame me.
