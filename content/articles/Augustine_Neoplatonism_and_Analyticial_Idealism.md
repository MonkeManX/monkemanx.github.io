Recently I have been reading the book Confession by Saint Augustine, and found some similartiies in it to frist neoplantomism and anaylticial idealism. The former is unsuprising as he explciit states in his boo kthat he was inspired by thinkers like plotinus and pohphrrery, the later though being a rleative new theory is suprising.

So i nthis article I want to showcase some similarties between saint augustine idea of God and what betran kastrup calls mind at large in analysticial idealism.

Before i beginn, keep in mind that I am no scholar about either subjects, I just read one book for each topic on that, and neither can i calim orgiinality of this idea as i dont know thel iterature and if someoen else has written on this. Also I wont go inall the details in either philosophies, as sketch liek picture should suffice, for the topic of this article.

The article will be structured as follows, i nthe next seciton i will give a brief over of neotpanotism, then about naalyticial idealism and finaly i willl look at some imialritiedb etween them.


## What is neoplatonism

### A Precursor Platonsim

To udnerstand what neoplatonism is, we first need to understand what platonism is, as neoplatonsim arise as a way to handle crtiicer of plaotnism.

So whati s platonism? Plaotnism, gets its name from its founder plato, most famous for writing the socratic dialogues, a colelction of dialogues that involve his master socrates about vaious philosopial ideas, from what is beauty to how to build an ideal state. Togtehr plato and socrates are one of the msoti mprotantp hilosopehr in theh istory ofp hilsophers, and can be understood in some way as the start of popular western philosophy.

One of platos most out there idea, was the idea of the realm of forms. The realm of form is a hypothehtical world/realm/dimesnion/plane of higher existence, where all true objects lie.
The motivation for postualing this hypothethical world, is that his etacher socrates askes all these philosophical question like what is justice? what is courage? And so on, but whenever socreates confrotned someone with these question all he could get where examples for justice and courages, so specific instances in real life where somoen did somethin jsut or courageous. But that was enough for Plato, for plato jsutice and courage are not just a buch of examples but there must be something stable about it.

But here lies the problem, whenevr we look at our world everythig seems to be in flux and dynamic, there is no disitnct object justic or couragei n our world, just examples of it. Hence plato posutalted antoehr realm, the realm of forms or ideas, this as the name suggest is where these ideas like jsutice or courage lie. This explains why we have this seemingly contradiciton, between the apprarent dynamicness of oncepts while at the same tie being stbale, in our world they are dnymic while in theh igher realm they are stable.
One can image this, like baking christmas cookies, when baking christmas cookies we first make the dough and then we use a pre defined stacne and stance it i nodugh to make cookies, the stances itself ar per fect, stbale but when we make cookies they with it altough they where formed using the smae stance they all seem to have sighly different shapes, this is exarcly hwo palto throught baout things like jsutice, they are a from that exist in the higher world and they get isntancied in oru world which are then exmapels of justice.

### Critcism

But there exist some ovbious probelm with the platonic idea of a realm of forms. Foremost, altough itm ight explain why we perceive things categoricial, there are numersous other explanation where categories might comes from (e.g. socialy constructed), so why should this realm exist?

Neoplatonism by its ofunder plotnius is a reponse movemnt towards that tries to give an account of this realm of ideas came to be.

### Neoplatonsim

Like every good system be it religion, sicne or math, we need to start with a fe axioms, axioms are the elementary rules that cannot be proven but just need to be taken as matter of faith for example in math that al ine goes through points can be takens a axiom.
In neoplatonism the msot important axiom is the existene of god, who can be though of as being with all its attributes maximized. Most important for the topic at hand, is that the attribute of goodness is maximized in God. With which we can now make the following argument

If there was a being that hast eh same attribute as god but in addition has the asiblity to produce goodness, that thisb eing would be more good than God, but since god is maximum god this cannot be the case, hence god needs to be bale to produce goodness.

if this seems familar, this argument i already have explored in anotther article named [Nature of God](/articles/nature_of_god/).

Good so we have now a good that can prodcue goodness, how does htis help our problem of the existence of thep altonic realm?

## What is Anayltiical Idealism
