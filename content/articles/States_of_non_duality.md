    - Sex
        - Two subjects become one
    - Meditation
    - Religious Singing
    - Praying
        -  Basically the same as Meditations
- Chemicals
    - Psychedelics
        - Ego gets chemicaly diminished

Result is always the same -> loss of self, non-duality, union with god, partaking with the holy.
