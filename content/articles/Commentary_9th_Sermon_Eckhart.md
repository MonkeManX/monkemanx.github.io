I have used the original German text as a basis, as published by the [Reclam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reclam) publishing house. The text is translated by myself with the help of ChatGPT.

Furthermore, this is just my own interpretation of the text. I do not have any formal training in it, so take it with a grain of salt.

Last thing, I want to mention, is that i am better readi n the greeks than traditional chrisitan scholars, as such  ia mbiased in this direiton.

## About Meister Eckhart

[Meister Eckhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meister_Eckhart) was a German theologian, Catholic priest, and member of the [Dominican Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order) of the 13th century.

He is best known for his sermons, which he preached in German to laypeople instead of the usual Latin used by the clergy. His sermons are deeply mystical and filled with flowery prose. He was accused of heresy by the Church, but the charges were later dropped.


## Sermon 9


{{< primary >}}
"Like the morning star in the midst of the mist and like the full moon in its days and like the shining sun, so did he shine in the temple of God."
Now I hold on to the last word: "temple of God."
What is "God," and what is the "temple of God"?
{{< /primary >}}



The sermon starts with quote from the [Book Of Sirach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Sirach)([Sirach 50:6](https://biblia.com/bible/douayrheims/sirach/50/6-10)), this book is part of Catchothlic bilbe but not of the proetsant canon, so dont be suprised if you cant find it.

While the quote in book of sirach, descirbes the outwards apperance of the high priest simon son of onias, Eckhart takes this imagery and transposes it from something external, to a symbol of the inner, the he is not anymore simon the priest, but a soul enlightened by God, the temple of God no longe physcial but a representation of the soul itself. This will become clearer later on.

Based on this Eckhart asks the question that defiens the rest of this sermon, he is interested in the metaphysical reality of God? Who is god truly?


{{< primary >}}
Twenty-four masters came together and wanted to speak about what God is. They came at the appointed time, and each presented his statement, of which I now choose two or three.
 
The first said: "God is something in comparison to which all changeable and temporal things are nothing, and everything that has being is insignificant before Him."
The second said: "God is something that necessarily stands above being, that in itself needs nothing, but is needed by all things."
The third said: "God is a rationality that lives solely through the knowledge of itself."
{{< /primary >}}


Eckhart now gives us three competing definiton of God could be. The first master definition fits in with radisiton such as [Anselm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anselm_of_Canterbury), who defined god as the greatest conceivable being.

The third master deifnition is more in line of the conept of the logos, like formulated with aristotele and stoics, altought the stoic concept of logos is more on the cosmic level, as such aristoteles conception is more fitting whch can be seen through

> thinking is thinking of thinking
> 
> ~ Metaphysics 1074b34–35

The second definition is on which Eckhard wants to focus in his susbequent text, it is clearly inspired by neoplatonic thought of "The one"

> And all of these up to the Good are beautiful, but **it itself is above** Beauty and is the transcendent ruler of all that is best, all that is in the intelligible world
>
> ~ Ennead 1.8(51)§1.8.2.

In neoplaonic though, the one is identified with god and it is from which everything stems from, thus every being dependent on it, while at the same time being nesccary and not in need of anything; it overflows purely from its own abundance. Further all things seek to return to the one, because tehy yeran for it, and need it as source.



{{< primary >}}
I set aside the first and the last and speak of the second, which says that God must necessarily stand above being. Whatever has being, time, or place does not reach up to God—He is beyond it. God is in all creatures insofar as they have being, and yet He is beyond them. The very thing He is in all creatures, He is also beyond them; what is one in many things must necessarily be beyond those things.
 
Some masters believed that the soul was only in the heart. This is not so, and in this regard great masters have erred. The soul is whole and entire in the foot and entire in the eye and in every single limb.
 
If I take a segment of time, it is neither today nor yesterday. But if I take the Now, it encompasses all time within itself. The Now in which God created the world is as close to the present time as the Now in which I am now speaking, and the Last Day is as close to this Now as the day that was yesterday.
{{< /primary >}}



Eckhard states: "He is in all creatures, He is also beyond them;", What does he mean with that?

Echkard belives, that God is funadmentally different to eevrything else that exist, asking question like "Wher does God exist?"(Place) or "Did God always exist?"(Time), do not make any sense, this is like asking "Is the number four blue?", what you do here is a [category error], just like a number and a color is a different cetagory so is God and time and space, thus god is beyond them.

But at the same time he is also belived that God is within everything, this again harps back to the neoplatonic notion of "The One", where God is like a concenctrated force, from which everthign else innamentates from, like a brunnen which overflows with water, God overflows and produces the Creation, which by coming from god is part of him, all creation has a spark of divinity by the nature of how it came into the existance, this is why he says "The soul is whole and entire...", here soul stands for the spark of divinity which is not at an particular place but in evertyhing, the souls essence is individable and unconfined by space.

> How, then, do they[the intelligible world] arise out of aimple One? [...]
>
> In fact, it is because there was nothing in that that all things come from it, and, in order that Being should exist, it is not Being but the gernarot of it. [...]
>
> All these things are the One and not the one; they  are the one, because they are from it; they are not the One, becaue it endowed them with what they are while remaining  by itself."
>
> ~ Ennead 5.2(11)

Another similar notion is that of Paul Tillich, which speaks about God as the "Grund"(Ground) of being, of this which makes existance possible in the first place, he is **becoming**, that makes out of nothing something, he gives the creation the ability to resist non-being, and through that becoems part of them.

> The being of God is being-itself. The being of God cannot be understood as the existence of a being alongside others or above others. If God is a being, he is subject to the categories of finitude, especially to space and substance. Even if he is called the “highest being” in the sense of the “most perfect” and the “most powerful” being, this situation is not changed. [...]
>
>  Many confusions in the doctrine of God and many apologetic weaknesses could be avoided if God were understood first of all as being-itself or as the ground of being. [...]
>
>  Therefore, instead of saying that God is first of all being-itself, it is possible to say that he is the power of being in everything and above everything, the infinite power of being.
>
> ~ Paul Tillich, Systematic Theology, Vol 1, Part 2, Chapter 2, B3a)

Lastly, the section about the time should elucidate, that God is also beyond time, Gods act of Creation is not just a past event, but somethign eternaly present, Gods "Now" encampoesse both present, past and futrue.



{{< primary >}}
 A master says: "God is something that acts in eternity, undivided in itself, that needs no one's help nor any tool, and remains in itself; that needs nothing, yet is needed by all things and to which all things strive as to their ultimate goal."
 This goal has no manner—it grows out of manner and expands beyond it.
 Saint Bernard says: "To love God is manner without manner."
 
 A physician who wants to heal a sick person has no fixed manner of health in mind, no specific degree to which he wants to make the person well. He certainly has a method by which he wants to heal him, but how healthy he wants to make him—that is without manner: as healthy as he possibly can.
 
 How much we should love God is subject to no fixed manner; as much as we are able to—that is without manner.
{{< /primary >}}

The thought of God as "all things strive as to their ultimate goal", is classical greek doctirne echoed by thinkers like aristotele, who speaks about god a the prime mover, the first in a chain of causal events i nhis [unmoved mover argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmoved_mover) and neoplatontic like plotinus, who think the souls yearns to return to the One, which is also deeply connected to Eckard notion of love for God

> The soul in its nature loves God and longs to be at one with Him in the noble love of a daughter for a noble father; but coming to human birth and lured by the courtships of this sphere, she takes up with another love, a mortal, leaves her father and falls.
> 
> But one day coming to hate her shame, she puts away the evil of earth, once more seeks the father, and finds her peace. 
> 
> ~ Enneads VI, 6.9(09), §6.9.9 

Eckhart not just rpeats these ideas but adapt them in a christian framing, in the line of christian theologians like St. Augustine in the book of confession

> O Lord, and our heart is restless until it rests in you.
> 
> ~ Confessions


{{< primary >}}
 Every thing acts according to its being; no thing is capable of acting beyond its being. Fire cannot act outside of wood. God, however, acts beyond being, into the expanse, wherever He is able to move Himself: He acts in non-being. Before there was being, God was already acting. He brought about being when there was no being yet.
 
 Crude-minded masters say that God is pure being. But He stands as far above being as the highest angel is above a gnat! I would be speaking falsely if I were to call God a being—just as if I were to call the sun pale or black. God is neither this nor that.
 
 And a master says: whoever thinks he has known God—even if he has recognized something—has not recognized God.
 
 However, when I have said that God is not a being, but rather beyond being, I have not thereby denied Him being; on the contrary: I have exalted it in Him. If I perceive copper in gold, then it is present, and it is present in a higher way than it is in itself.
 
 Saint Augustine says: "God is wise without wisdom, good without goodness, mighty without might."
{{< /primary >}}



This again goes back to the notion that calling God a being is a cetrgory error, critcising theologians lik Thomas Aquinas who call **God being itself** with hsi famous saying 

> ipsum esse subsistens
> Ostensum est autem supra, cum de divina simplicitate ageretur, quod Deus est **ipsum esse per se subsistens**.  
> (It has been shown above, when treating of the divine simplicity, that **God is being itself subsisting**.)
>
> ~ Summa Theologiae, Prima Pars, Question 44, Article 1

By prescribing certain properties to God, we also limit his power, e.g. if we say a table is made of wood it can be mde out of stone, jus like this if we say God is a being or even being itself, then Gd is boudn by teh restriction that a being has. Antoher exmaple for a cetgrory error is "call the sun pale or black", or one that i like more is "Music is delicious", we can say music is liek a delicious meal, but msuic is not edible thus not delicous, callign it that would be category error, a meaningelss statement that does not make sense. For more on this see my article on the [Ontological Argument](/articles/ontological_argument_and_apophatic_theology/#43-limitation-of-god) where i wrote about this.

The second part of this section, is that just because I cant say God is a ebing or that God is wise, does not mean I lessen him or put him down, in fact the opposite, by saying god is wise or a being, i put God in the same categroy as humans, but he is far beyond us humans, thus we cant describe god in human cocnepts.

That is not to say that we cant talk about God, but just like Saint Agusutine says, whe nwe describe God using humans cocnepts like Good or Wise, what we do is not how God really is, but its more liek a metaphor that tries to approximate him just like saying "music is delicious".

But eckhard thinkgs, we can only get truly nearer to God through **negative theology** by describing what God is not e.g. God is not being, he is ebyond it, God is not wise, he is beodn wise.



{{< primary >}}
 Lesser masters teach in schools that all beings are divided into ten modes of being, and they deny all of these to God. None of these modes touches God, yet He lacks none of them either.
 
 The first, which possesses the most being and from which all things receive their being, is substance; and the last, which contains the least being, is called relation. And this relation is equal in God—the Greatest One, who possesses the most being. They all share the same archetype in God. In God, the archetypes of all things are equal; but they are archetypes of unequal things. The highest angel, the soul, and the gnat all have the same archetype in God.
 
 God is neither goodness nor being. Goodness adheres to being and is no broader than being; for if there were no being, there would be no goodness, and being is purer still than goodness.
 
 God is neither good nor better nor best of all. Whoever says that God is good does Him as much injustice as one who would call the sun black.
{{< /primary >}}



The ten modes of being are a reference to the [aristotelian categories](https://stgb.substack.com/p/aristotles-ten-categories-of-being) that got adapted by the later scholastic thinker like Aquinas

> Of things said without any combination, each signifies either **substance** or **quantity** or **qualification** or a **relative** or **where** or **when** or **being-in-a-position** or **having** or **doing** or **being-affected**. To give a rough idea, examples of *substance* are man, horse; of *quantity:* four-foot, five-foot; of *qualification:* white, grammatical; of a *relative:* double, half, larger; of *where:* in the Lyceum, in the market-place; of *when:* yesterday, last-year; of *being-in-a-position:* is-lying, is-sitting; of *having:* has-shoes-on, has-armour-on; of *doing:* cutting, burning; of *being-affected:* being-cut, being-burned.
> 
> ~ Organon, Categories, 1b25–2a4

All these categories people in the shcoalstic tradition have sued to descirbe all possible things like apples, chairs, morality or love, do not apply to God, we cant say he has them nor can we say he has them not "None of these modes touches God, yet He lacks none of them either", God is beyond them.


When Eckhard speaks about archetype what he means are these kind of platonic ideas, which we can abstract away crom everyday objects towards soemthign more general e.g. we have all kinds of different apples but they all share the same archtepye/platonic idea of an apple. 

> Well then, here are three beds: one existing in nature, which is made by God, as I think that we may say--for no one else can be the maker?
> 
> No.
>
> There is another which is the work of the carpenter?
> 
> Yes.
> 
> And the work of the painter is a third?
> 
> Yes.
>
> Beds, then, are of three kinds, and there are three artists who superintend them: God, the maker of the bed, and the painter?
>
> Yes, there are three of them. [...]
>
> God knew this, and He desired to be the real maker of a real bed, not a particular maker of a particular bed, and therefore He created a bed which is **essentially and by nature one only** [The Form].
> 
> ~ Republic, Book 10,  597b–598d

And when he speaks about that this archetype is shared in God, what he means is tthis geenral idea of eevryday objects comes from God, the platonic ideals can be found in God.
Further we have no hierachical differences between creatures, a gnat or ant is the same as angel to God, because it doesnt matter if ant or angel both are still part of this world, part of being, but only god is beyond that, in that sense an ant or angel are the same to him.

And just like we cant prescibe modes of being to God, we cant prescibe goodness to hi, since goodness is property or predicate that arises from beings, but gos transcentds being, thsu also transcends goodness.

Thus if we say God is good we insult him, for we pull him down on the level of ants and angles, saying God is good is as wrogn as saying the "sun is black".



{{< primary >}}
 Yet God Himself says: “No one is good except God alone.” (Mark 10:18)
 What is good? That which communicates itself. We call a person good who is sociable and beneficial. That is why a pagan master says: “A hermit is neither good nor evil in this sense, for he is neither sociable nor useful.”
 
 God is the most self-communicating of all. No thing communicates from its own essence, for all creatures are nothing in and of themselves. What they communicate, they have received from another. They also do not give themselves. The sun gives its light and yet remains where it is; fire gives its heat and yet remains fire. But God communicates what is His own, because He is what He is from Himself, and in all the gifts He gives, He first gives Himself.
 
 He gives Himself as God, as He is, in all His gifts—according to the capacity of the one who is able to receive Him.
 
 Saint James says: “Every good gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights.” (James 1:17)
{{< /primary >}}



Here, Eckhart addresses a deep theological question:
**If God is truly beyond all being and beyond all categories, including goodness, why does scripture call God “good”?**

To answer this, Eckhart links goodness to **self-communication**. He argues that something is called “good” when it **gives of itself** or **interacts benevolently with others**. This makes sense when we consider the **etymology of “morality”**, which comes from the Latin *moralis*, meaning something like *pertaining to manners or conduct*—that is, how one **acts toward others**. So: if goodness is a kind of **relational behavior**, how can someone be “good” in **complete isolation**?

This is why God is the **ultimate form of goodness**:

**God is the most self-communicating of all.**
All things come from Him. Everything we share or give to others ultimately has its origin in God. And unlike us, whose giving is separate from our essence (I can give without *being* the gift), **God’s essence *is* the act of giving itself**.

So in this sense, we humans can **have** goodness as a quality or attribute, while **God *is* goodness itself**—*not as a moral quality, but as infinite self-giving being*.
At first glance, this seems to **contradict** Eckhart’s earlier claim that God is beyond all categories, including goodness. But Eckhart would say: **this contradiction is not a flaw—it is the point**.

There are two reasons why this contradiction is essential:

1. **Mysticism thrives on paradox**. When we reach the limits of what language and logic can express, we begin to touch the divine. Only where language fails—where it breaks apart in contradiction—do we start to approach God, who is beyond all form, word, and concept.
2. When we say **“God is goodness,”** we do not mean He fits within our usual human category of goodness. Instead, we mean **He is the source from which all real goodness flows**.
   This is where the analogy helps:

**Ice is a form of water, but water is beyond ice—it can be solid, liquid, or gas.**
In this way, **goodness is like ice**, and **God is like water**. Goodness *emerges from* God but **does not exhaust** what God is. God is the source and ground of all goodness, without being *limited* to it.



{{< primary >}}
 When we grasp God in being, we grasp Him in His courtyard, for being is His courtyard in which He dwells. But where is He then in His temple, in which He appears as holy? Rationality is the temple of God. Nowhere does God dwell more truly than in His temple—in rationality, as that other master said: God is a rationality that lives solely in the knowledge of itself, remaining alone in itself, where nothing has ever touched Him, for He alone is there in His stillness.
 
 God, in the knowledge of Himself, knows Himself in Himself.
{{< /primary >}}



Here we we use a spatial metaphor to differentiate between two levels of undertsndaing of God:
1. **Courtyard:** We are near the house of God, but not inside it, a superciial indirect knoweldge of God, we do not know hsi true essence.
2. **The Temple:** We are inside Gods house, which stands for a more intimate knowledge of God

The first understanding of the courtyard is how God appear to us through his **works** that is scriptue i.e. the bible and his Creation i.e nature, that which we see everyday, in short through outward experience.
The second more intimitae understanding of God, is i nrationality, with which rationality does not mean logical argumentative sylogicstic thinking like that of anayltical philisopy, think of statements liek 1 + 1 = 2, but instead from deep contempaltion and mysticial expeirence, by switch from looking outward to the inward, think more align of the continental philosophers, insetad of harsh logical statemnt in poesm and music, in short in beauty, a truth more felt and expeirence imemditate then deduced.
This rationaltiy is not gotten through outwards looking, but by looking inwards in solitude "remaining alone in itself" and stillness "is there in His stillness".

The final sentence, is of tautological nature, i.e. s sentence that is true by definition. 
This is not by accident, it potrays God in this complete self-referential, utterly closed to all externak grasping - paradoxical, god is alos open, because we can get clsoe to him throug this self-referential stillness in solitude.



{{< primary >}}
 Now let us consider \[cognition] in the soul, which possesses a tiny drop of rationality, a little spark, a small branch. The soul has powers that operate within the body.
 
 There is one power through which a person digests; this works more at night than during the day—through it a person grows and gains strength. The soul also has a power in the eye, through which the eye is so sensitive and fine that it does not perceive things in their rawness as they are in themselves; rather, they must first be filtered and refined through the air and the light. This is because the eye has the soul with it.
 
 Another power is in the soul, with which it remembers. This power forms within itself images of things that are not present, so that I recognize these things just as well as if I were seeing them with my eyes—indeed, even better. I can easily imagine a rose in winter. And with this power the soul operates in non-being, and in doing so it follows God, who also works in non-being.
{{< /primary >}}


Picking up on the theme of rationality and deep contemplation, deep inside of us in our uteermost essence - our soul, we have a spark of divinity from God, this divinity can not be "seen" through our "rgular eyes" with which we see regular objects in fornt of us like chairs, trees or other people, insetad to *see* this divinity we need to use our soul, we need to look inwards, trhough an exhaustive mediation. This divnity is hidden, quiet iwards "active more at night than day".
This spark of divintiy goes back to the greeks such as the stoics 

> God is near you, he is with you, he is within you. This is what I mean, Lucilius: a holy spirit indwells within us, one who marks our good and bad deeds, and is our guardian.
>
> ~ Seneca, Letter XLI: "On the God Within Us"

Additional, our soul can remember, this means when we see, with see here is emant liek descibed above and not regular see, divinity we cn also recognize is as that. This reminds of platos dialogue meno, where he argues knowledge is nothign else than the soul recalling what it has forgotten

> The soul, then, as being immortal, and having been born again many times, and having seen all things that exist, whether in this world or in the world below, has knowledge of them all; and it is no wonder that she should be able to call to remembrance all that she ever knew about virtue, and about everything; for as all nature is akin, and the soul has learned all things; there is no difficulty in her eliciting or as men say learning, out of a single recollection all the rest, if a man is strenuous and does not faint; for all enquiry and all learning is but recollection"
>
> ~ Meno, 81d

But this power that echkard descbribes with remmebring goes further than simple recalls, it is pwoer to create, to reach into non-being, into possiblity, it enacts what Goed does, and thus move beyond what exists, in doing do it coems clsoer to god, who himself is beyond all what exists.

 A pagan master says: “The soul that loves God grasps Him under the veil of goodness.”
 All of what has been mentioned so far are still the words of pagan masters; they recognized nothing except by the natural light. I have not yet reached the words of the holy masters, who recognized in a much higher light.
 
 This one says: “The soul that loves God, loves Him under the veil of goodness.”
Rationality strips away from God the veil of goodness and grasps Him bare, where He is stripped of goodness, of being, and of all names.
{{< /primary >}}



It is a mistake to try to understand God through human notions of goodness—to “grasp Him under the veil of goodness.” When we impose our limited, human concepts on God, we inevitably fail to see Him as He truly is. This is the level of a "Pagan Master".

True knowledge of God does not come from conceptual grasping or defining God according to familiar categories. Instead, it arises when we love God despite our inability to understand Him fully.

Only by suspending all preconceived knowledge and concepts about God—by letting go of what we think we know—and turning inward to the depths of our own being, can we begin to encounter God in His true essence. Then we can be called a "Holy Master".



{{< primary >}}
 I said in school that rationality is nobler than will, and yet both belong to this \[higher] light. But a master in another school said that will is nobler than rationality, because will takes things as they are in themselves, whereas rationality takes things as they are in itself. This is true. An eye is nobler in itself than an eye painted on a wall.
 
 But I say that rationality is nobler than will. Will takes God under the garment of goodness. Rationality takes God bare, as He is stripped of goodness and of being. Goodness is a garment under which God is hidden, and will takes God under the garment of goodness. If there were no goodness in God, my will would not desire Him.
 
 Whoever were to clothe a king on the day of his coronation in gray garments would not have dressed him fittingly. I am not blessed because God is good. I never want to desire that God bless me through His goodness, for He would not be able to do so. I am blessed solely because God is rational and I recognize this.
 
 A master says: “It is God’s rationality on which the being of the angel wholly depends.”
 One might ask where the being of an image truly resides: in the mirror or in that from which it proceeds. It resides more truly in that from which it proceeds. The image is in me, from me, and toward me. As long as the mirror stands unchanged before my face, my image remains in it; if the mirror falls, the image vanishes.
 
 The being of the angel depends on the presence of divine rationality, in which he recognizes himself.
{{< /primary >}}


Eckhart deifferentiates betwenen rationality and will, rationality is this deep cotemplative focus on the inenr, while will is the power of the sould that chooses and desire. Whiel rationality si abotu knowing, will is about longing.

Some say the will of God is betetr than the rationality of God, because will sees things how they truly are unfiltered, while rationality sees more like how thing appear, less direct, less immediate.

He uses an eye to clarify this concept, the eye represents the will that sees how thingrealyl are, while the painint of an eye or the relfection of an eye sees the world filtered through the painting or relfection.

While he agrees with thi concept, he still things rationality is superior to will, because rationality “takes God bare” aphrends God in pure nakednedd, while will “takes God under the garment of goodness,” meaning it grasps God only through mediated qualities like goodness.

How does this make sense? Shouldn it be exactly the opposite, being that will is unfiltered an biased, while raitonaltiy is not?

For eckhard will relates to the faculatuy of love and desire, which is nesscery conencted to the cocnept of goodness, so altought we can say that will is more primtiive, as in comign before, rationality, is is still filtered thorugh the "Animal Parts" or as aristotele calls them "irrational par of soul"

> That one element in the soul is irrational and one has a rational principle. [...]
> For we praise the rational principle of the continent man and of the incontinent, and the part of their soul that has such a principle, since it urges them aright and towards the best objects; but there is found in them also another element naturally opposed to the rational principle, which fights against and resists that principle. 
> 
> ~ Nicomachean Ethics, Chapter 13

if we try to grasp god through will we always will look at him through a lesne of desire and thus goodness, but god is beyond goodness and thus we can onyl undertsnadh im through more contemplative meassure, and even though rationality too is biased, in concemplation we have the chanche to recognize this and stripe away, shwich we do nto have with will, ebcause it is so primtive. 

As metpahor, eckhard  speakf of "clothe a king on the day of his coronation in gray garments", smybolizing that calling God merley "good" is not enoug hand inappripiate.
Only when we have striped God from the "veil of goodness", emaning onyl when we do not look at god udner human cocneption liek goodness, can we see him for how he truly is.

In the mepaohor with the angles, eckhard clarifies the importance of raitonality, being of angels depends on the presence of divine rationalit, they recognize thei own being in god raitonality, thus the angles are image of the mirror, while god is the source of the image.
Without God’s rationality, their being would vanish, just as the image disappears if the mirror falls.

 "Like the morning star in the midst of the fog." I focus on the little word "quasi," which means "just like" or "as if." The children in school call this a "modifier." This is what I have in mind in all my sermons.
 
 The most essential thing one can say about God is "Word" and "Truth." God called Himself a Word. Saint John said: "In the beginning was the Word" (John 1:1), and he means that there should be a modifier with this Word.
 
 Just like the "free star," after which Friday is named—the Venus: it has many names. When it rises before the sun and appears earlier than the sun, it is called "the morning star." But when it follows the sun, so that the sun sets earlier, it is called "the evening star." Sometimes it moves above the sun, sometimes below the sun. Among all the stars, it remains constantly near the sun. It never moves farther from or closer to it.
 
 It stands for a person who wants to reach this goal; such a person should always be near to God and present to Him, so that nothing may remove him from God—not happiness nor misfortune, nor any creature.

The section begins with relapse towards the beginning of the sermon, with the quote from the book of ssirach, in which the morningstar representing the venus, becomes anow  symbol for our soul looking for God, our soul shining bright liek the morning star in midst of confusion(fog).

He wants to focues on the word "quasi", highlithgint that whenever he speaks about God he does not descirbe how god truly is, but as a analogy of apprixmation, this is also tue for what he says about God.

Continuing with the analogy form before, the [venus is the same as the morning star and the evening star](https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/venus-morning-star-evening-star), (a comaprsion that is gladly used by the philosopher frege when he speaks abotu [lagnuage and their meaning](/paper-summary/on_senses_and_references/), but thats besided the point), this venus is always near the sun never going to far away, soemtimes below, osmetime above, soemtimes, before, soemtime after, but alwys near the sund. Here the sun represent god and divinity and the venus us, mroep receisely our souls, just like the venus stays near the sun, so should our soul stay near god, in otehr words Spiritual steadfastness is the key.

 He \[the text] continues: “Like the full moon in its days.” The moon exercises dominion over all moist nature. The moon is never as close to the sun as when it is full and receives its light directly from the sun. However, because it is closer to the earth than any other star, it has two disadvantages: it is pale and spotted, and it loses its light. It is never as strong as when it is farthest from the earth, for then it causes the sea to ebb the most; the more it wanes, the less it can do this.
 
 The more the soul is elevated above earthly things, the more powerful it is. Whoever recognized nothing but creatures would never think of a sermon, for every creature is full of God and is a book.
 
 A person who wants to reach what has just been spoken of here—this is the whole point of the entire discourse—must be like the morning star: always present to God and always near Him, equally close, raised above all earthly things, and be an attribute to the Word.

The quote from sirach continues, this time we have the symbol of a moon, representing a **full** soul, the moon receives its light directly form the sun, liek a full sun that is completly open and oriented towards god.

The stars that nearer to god, represent higher being, that are neared to god such as angles, compared to them ebcause we are further away even if our sould is full and irected towards gog, we loose the light of the sun faster, representing that we stray form the path from god thorugh eahy distraction, and only when we are far awy fro mthe god, we are msot powerful, this representing being far away from the mundae affairs of life and the daiyl troubles.

> In fact, purification would be leaving it [The Soul] alone and not with others [The Senses] or not looking at something else [External Things] and in consequence not having beliefs [Opinions] which are alien to it [Believing Pleasure, Pain of importance] – whatever is the nature of the beliefs or of the affections [Emtions, Desire, Fears, ect.], as has been said – and not looking at images [Fantasies froom Desire] or making affections derived from them.

And all creatures have god within them, but only if one focuses on the divine, spiritual insight can be produces, like the morningstar alway hovering the sun, so should we hover god, like a morning star far above the eart and world desire.

 There is a spoken word—that is the angel, the human, and all creatures. There is another word, thought and spoken; in this, it can happen that I imagine something. Yet there is another word that never ever comes forth; it is rather eternally within the one who speaks it. It is always in a state of being received in the Father who speaks it, and yet it remains abiding.
 
 Rationality works entirely inwardly. The finer and more spiritual a thing is, the more powerfully it works inwardly. And the stronger and finer the rationality is, the more what it recognizes becomes united with it, and the more it becomes one with it.
 
 This is not the case with physical things; the stronger they are, the more they work outwardly.
 
 God’s blessedness lies in the inward working of rationality, where the Word abides.
 
 There the soul should be an attribute and work a single work with God, to grasp its blessedness in the knowledge floating within itself—in that very place where God is blessed.

God is often associated with the word in chrisitanity and with the logos in ancient greek hpsilosophy, both meaning the same, logos being greek for word.

> In the beginning the **Word** already existed.
>    The Word was with God,
>    and the Word was God.
> He existed in the beginning with God.  
> God created everything through him,
>    and nothing was created except through him.  
> The Word gave life to everything that was created,
>    and his life brought light to everyone.
> 
> ~ John 1:1-4


> Of this *logos* which holds always, humans prove to be uncomprehending, both before they hear it and after hearing it for the first time. 
> For although all things come to be in accordance with this *logos*, they are like the unexperienced experiencing words and deeds such a I explain when I distinguish each thing according to its nature and show how it is. 
> Other men are unaware of what they do when they are awake just as they are forgetful of what they do when they are asleep.
>
> ~ Heraclitus, Fragment B1 

This word orl ogos can be seperated into three levels:
1. **spoke otwardly:** these are angels, humans and all other creatures they are psoken in teh sense that they are created by god.
2. **thoigh and spoken:** thes is the imaginative world, which we cna think of that, in this sense they are spoken.
3. **the word tha never come:** this is the eternal and unchanging world of word/logos, it does not exist in our relaity or world, but exist only in eternal unity in God "eternally within the one who speaks"., it is always in a state of "becoming" as paul tillic hwould say "ways in a state of being received".

And we come clpser to good *the word that never come*, by looking inward of us through *thoughts and spoken*, because their "God's blessedness lies" and not in the outward physical things *spoken outwardly*, and we should do this inwards looking through rationality, a contemplative medivitive process.

And we, our soulds hsould not be a merely servant of God, but an attribute of him, we should participate in gods own being, this reminds of other mystic that speak of a deep union with god

> I saw no difference between God and our substance: but as it were all God; and yet mine understanding took that our substance is in God: that is to say, that God is God, and our substance is a creature in God.

 That we may always be an attribute to this Word, may the Father, this very Word, and the Holy Spirit help us. Amen.

I want to edn with the following thought 

> The Poetry does not matter, what matters is what the poem points at hwat it allows us to see, feel, and most of all hear. If poetry were ever to reach its goal, fidn at what it aims at, than this would lead anihaltion of poetry.  
> The idea of decreation is imporant,  since The only way we can draw close to the thing itself, is by approaching it from negatives, by using logic of poetry of ascendation and negation, that percede, through contradiction, antitheses and paradox.   
> Disjoint opposite, does not result in anything positive, it is rather through the continious workd of negation that word can point darkly as what surpasses them. The thing itself, can only find voice when words break.
>
> ~ On Mysticism: The Experience of Ectasy.

In the end, the content of meister echkard sermon is not what really matters, what matters is what it aims at, the unintelligible connection with the divine it provides us.
