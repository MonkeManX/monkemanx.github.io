I have used the original German text as a basis, as published by the [Reclam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reclam) publishing house. The text is translated by myself with the help of ChatGPT.

Furthermore, this is just my own interpretation of the text. I do not have any formal training in it, so take it with a grain of salt.

Last thing, I want to mention, is that i am better readi n the greeks than traditional chrisitan scholars, as such  ia mbiased in this direiton.

## About Meister Eckhart

[Meister Eckhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meister_Eckhart) was a German theologian, Catholic priest, and member of the [Dominican Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order) of the 13th century.

He is best known for his sermons, which he preached in German to laypeople instead of the usual Latin used by the clergy. His sermons are deeply mystical and filled with flowery prose. He was accused of heresy by the Church, but the charges were later dropped.


## Sermon 9


{{< primary >}}
"Like the morning star in the midst of the mist and like the full moon in its days and like the shining sun, so did he shine in the temple of God."
Now I hold on to the last word: "temple of God."
What is "God," and what is the "temple of God"?
{{< /primary >}}



The sermon starts with quote from the [Book Of Sirach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Sirach)([Sirach 50:6](https://biblia.com/bible/douayrheims/sirach/50/6-10)), this book is part of Catchothlic bilbe but not of the proetsant canon, so dont be suprised if you cant find it.

While the quote in book of sirach, descirbes the outwards apperance of the high priest simon son of onias, Eckhart takes this imagery and transposes it from something external, to a symbol of the inner, the he is not anymore simon the priest, but a soul enlightened by God, the temple of God no longe physcial but a representation of the soul itself. This will become clearer later on.

Based on this Eckhart asks the question that defiens the rest of this sermon, he is interested in the metaphysical reality of God? Who is god truly?


{{< primary >}}
Twenty-four masters came together and wanted to speak about what God is. They came at the appointed time, and each presented his statement, of which I now choose two or three.
 
The first said: "God is something in comparison to which all changeable and temporal things are nothing, and everything that has being is insignificant before Him."
The second said: "God is something that necessarily stands above being, that in itself needs nothing, but is needed by all things."
The third said: "God is a rationality that lives solely through the knowledge of itself."
{{< /primary >}}


Eckhart now gives us three competing definiton of God could be. The first master definition fits in with radisiton such as [Anselm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anselm_of_Canterbury), who defined god as the greatest conceivable being.

The third master deifnition is more in line of the conept of the logos, like formulated with aristotele and stoics, altought the stoic concept of logos is more on the cosmic level, as such aristoteles conception is more fitting whch can be seen through

> thinking is thinking of thinking
> 
> ~ Metaphysics 1074b34–35

The second definition is on which Eckhard wants to focus in his susbequent text, it is clearly inspired by neoplatonic thought of "The one"

> And all of these up to the Good are beautiful, but **it itself is above** Beauty and is the transcendent ruler of all that is best, all that is in the intelligible world
>
> ~ Ennead 1.8(51)§1.8.2.

In neoplaonic though, the one is identified with god and it is from which everything stems from, thus every being dependent on it, while at the same time being nesccary and not in need of anything; it overflows purely from its own abundance. Further all things seek to return to the one, because tehy yeran for it, and need it as source.



{{< primary >}}
I set aside the first and the last and speak of the second, which says that God must necessarily stand above being. Whatever has being, time, or place does not reach up to God—He is beyond it. God is in all creatures insofar as they have being, and yet He is beyond them. The very thing He is in all creatures, He is also beyond them; what is one in many things must necessarily be beyond those things.
 
Some masters believed that the soul was only in the heart. This is not so, and in this regard great masters have erred. The soul is whole and entire in the foot and entire in the eye and in every single limb.
 
If I take a segment of time, it is neither today nor yesterday. But if I take the Now, it encompasses all time within itself. The Now in which God created the world is as close to the present time as the Now in which I am now speaking, and the Last Day is as close to this Now as the day that was yesterday.
{{< /primary >}}



Eckhard states: "He is in all creatures, He is also beyond them;", What does he mean with that?

Echkard belives, that God is funadmentally different to eevrything else that exist, asking question like "Wher does God exist?"(Place) or "Did God always exist?"(Time), do not make any sense, this is like asking "Is the number four blue?", what you do here is a [category error], just like a number and a color is a different cetagory so is God and time and space, thus god is beyond them.

But at the same time he is also belived that God is within everything, this again harps back to the neoplatonic notion of "The One", where God is like a concenctrated force, from which everthign else innamentates from, like a brunnen which overflows with water, God overflows and produces the Creation, which by coming from god is part of him, all creation has a spark of divinity by the nature of how it came into the existance, this is why he says "The soul is whole and entire...", here soul stands for the spark of divinity which is not at an particular place but in evertyhing, the souls essence is individable and unconfined by space.

> How, then, do they[the intelligible world] arise out of aimple One? [...]
>
> In fact, it is because there was nothing in that that all things come from it, and, in order that Being should exist, it is not Being but the gernarot of it. [...]
>
> All these things are the One and not the one; they  are the one, because they are from it; they are not the One, becaue it endowed them with what they are while remaining  by itself."
>
> ~ Ennead 5.2(11)

Another similar notion is that of Paul Tillich, which speaks about God as the "Grund"(Ground) of being, of this which makes existance possible in the first place, he is **becoming**, that makes out of nothing something, he gives the creation the ability to resist non-being, and through that becoems part of them.

> The being of God is being-itself. The being of God cannot be understood as the existence of a being alongside others or above others. If God is a being, he is subject to the categories of finitude, especially to space and substance. Even if he is called the “highest being” in the sense of the “most perfect” and the “most powerful” being, this situation is not changed. [...]
>
>  Many confusions in the doctrine of God and many apologetic weaknesses could be avoided if God were understood first of all as being-itself or as the ground of being. [...]
>
>  Therefore, instead of saying that God is first of all being-itself, it is possible to say that he is the power of being in everything and above everything, the infinite power of being.
>
> ~ Paul Tillich, Systematic Theology, Vol 1, Part 2, Chapter 2, B3a)

Lastly, the section about the time should elucidate, that God is also beyond time, Gods act of Creation is not just a past event, but somethign eternaly present, Gods "Now" encampoesse both present, past and futrue.



{{< primary >}}
 A master says: "God is something that acts in eternity, undivided in itself, that needs no one's help nor any tool, and remains in itself; that needs nothing, yet is needed by all things and to which all things strive as to their ultimate goal."
 This goal has no manner—it grows out of manner and expands beyond it.
 Saint Bernard says: "To love God is manner without manner."
 
 A physician who wants to heal a sick person has no fixed manner of health in mind, no specific degree to which he wants to make the person well. He certainly has a method by which he wants to heal him, but how healthy he wants to make him—that is without manner: as healthy as he possibly can.
 
 How much we should love God is subject to no fixed manner; as much as we are able to—that is without manner.
{{< /primary >}}

The thought of God as "all things strive as to their ultimate goal", is classical greek doctirne echoed by thinkers like aristotele, who speaks about god a the prime mover, the first in a chain of causal events i nhis [unmoved mover argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmoved_mover) and neoplatontic like plotinus, who think the souls yearns to return to the One, which is also deeply connected to Eckard notion of love for God

> The soul in its nature loves God and longs to be at one with Him in the noble love of a daughter for a noble father; but coming to human birth and lured by the courtships of this sphere, she takes up with another love, a mortal, leaves her father and falls.
> 
> But one day coming to hate her shame, she puts away the evil of earth, once more seeks the father, and finds her peace. 
> 
> ~ Enneads VI, 6.9(09), §6.9.9 

Eckhart not just rpeats these ideas but adapt them in a christian framing, in the line of christian theologians like St. Augustine in the book of confession

> O Lord, and our heart is restless until it rests in you.


{{< primary >}}
 Every thing acts according to its being; no thing is capable of acting beyond its being. Fire cannot act outside of wood. God, however, acts beyond being, into the expanse, wherever He is able to move Himself: He acts in non-being. Before there was being, God was already acting. He brought about being when there was no being yet.
 
 Crude-minded masters say that God is pure being. But He stands as far above being as the highest angel is above a gnat! I would be speaking falsely if I were to call God a being—just as if I were to call the sun pale or black. God is neither this nor that.
 
 And a master says: whoever thinks he has known God—even if he has recognized something—has not recognized God.
 
 However, when I have said that God is not a being, but rather beyond being, I have not thereby denied Him being; on the contrary: I have exalted it in Him. If I perceive copper in gold, then it is present, and it is present in a higher way than it is in itself.
 
 Saint Augustine says: "God is wise without wisdom, good without goodness, mighty without might."

{{< primary >}}
 Lesser masters teach in schools that all beings are divided into ten modes of being, and they deny all of these to God. None of these modes touches God, yet He lacks none of them either.
 
 The first, which possesses the most being and from which all things receive their being, is substance; and the last, which contains the least being, is called relation. And this relation is equal in God—the Greatest One, who possesses the most being. They all share the same archetype in God. In God, the archetypes of all things are equal; but they are archetypes of unequal things. The highest angel, the soul, and the gnat all have the same archetype in God.
 
 God is neither goodness nor being. Goodness adheres to being and is no broader than being; for if there were no being, there would be no goodness, and being is purer still than goodness.
 
 God is neither good nor better nor best of all. Whoever says that God is good does Him as much injustice as one who would call the sun black.
{{< /primary >}}





{{< primary >}}
 Yet God Himself says: “No one is good except God alone.” (Mark 10:18)
 What is good? That which communicates itself. We call a person good who is sociable and beneficial. That is why a pagan master says: “A hermit is neither good nor evil in this sense, for he is neither sociable nor useful.”
 
 God is the most self-communicating of all. No thing communicates from its own essence, for all creatures are nothing in and of themselves. What they communicate, they have received from another. They also do not give themselves. The sun gives its light and yet remains where it is; fire gives its heat and yet remains fire. But God communicates what is His own, because He is what He is from Himself, and in all the gifts He gives, He first gives Himself.
 
 He gives Himself as God, as He is, in all His gifts—according to the capacity of the one who is able to receive Him.
 
 Saint James says: “Every good gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights.” (James 1:17)

{{< primary >}}
 When we grasp God in being, we grasp Him in His courtyard, for being is His courtyard in which He dwells. But where is He then in His temple, in which He appears as holy? Rationality is the temple of God. Nowhere does God dwell more truly than in His temple—in rationality, as that other master said: God is a rationality that lives solely in the knowledge of itself, remaining alone in itself, where nothing has ever touched Him, for He alone is there in His stillness.
 
 God, in the knowledge of Himself, knows Himself in Himself.

{{< primary >}}
 Now let us consider \[cognition] in the soul, which possesses a tiny drop of rationality, a little spark, a small branch. The soul has powers that operate within the body.
 
 There is one power through which a person digests; this works more at night than during the day—through it a person grows and gains strength. The soul also has a power in the eye, through which the eye is so sensitive and fine that it does not perceive things in their rawness as they are in themselves; rather, they must first be filtered and refined through the air and the light. This is because the eye has the soul with it.
 
 Another power is in the soul, with which it remembers. This power forms within itself images of things that are not present, so that I recognize these things just as well as if I were seeing them with my eyes—indeed, even better. I can easily imagine a rose in winter. And with this power the soul operates in non-being, and in doing so it follows God, who also works in non-being.

 A pagan master says: “The soul that loves God grasps Him under the veil of goodness.”
 All of what has been mentioned so far are still the words of pagan masters; they recognized nothing except by the natural light. I have not yet reached the words of the holy masters, who recognized in a much higher light.
 
 This one says: “The soul that loves God, loves Him under the veil of goodness.”
Rationality strips away from God the veil of goodness and grasps Him bare, where He is stripped of goodness, of being, and of all names.
{{< /primary >}}





{{< primary >}}
 I said in school that rationality is nobler than will, and yet both belong to this \[higher] light. But a master in another school said that will is nobler than rationality, because will takes things as they are in themselves, whereas rationality takes things as they are in itself. This is true. An eye is nobler in itself than an eye painted on a wall.
 
 But I say that rationality is nobler than will. Will takes God under the garment of goodness. Rationality takes God bare, as He is stripped of goodness and of being. Goodness is a garment under which God is hidden, and will takes God under the garment of goodness. If there were no goodness in God, my will would not desire Him.
 
 Whoever were to clothe a king on the day of his coronation in gray garments would not have dressed him fittingly. I am not blessed because God is good. I never want to desire that God bless me through His goodness, for He would not be able to do so. I am blessed solely because God is rational and I recognize this.
 
 A master says: “It is God’s rationality on which the being of the angel wholly depends.”
 One might ask where the being of an image truly resides: in the mirror or in that from which it proceeds. It resides more truly in that from which it proceeds. The image is in me, from me, and toward me. As long as the mirror stands unchanged before my face, my image remains in it; if the mirror falls, the image vanishes.
 
 The being of the angel depends on the presence of divine rationality, in which he recognizes himself.

 "Like the morning star in the midst of the fog." I focus on the little word "quasi," which means "just like" or "as if." The children in school call this a "modifier." This is what I have in mind in all my sermons.
 
 The most essential thing one can say about God is "Word" and "Truth." God called Himself a Word. Saint John said: "In the beginning was the Word" (John 1:1), and he means that there should be a modifier with this Word.
 
 Just like the "free star," after which Friday is named—the Venus: it has many names. When it rises before the sun and appears earlier than the sun, it is called "the morning star." But when it follows the sun, so that the sun sets earlier, it is called "the evening star." Sometimes it moves above the sun, sometimes below the sun. Among all the stars, it remains constantly near the sun. It never moves farther from or closer to it.
 
 It stands for a person who wants to reach this goal; such a person should always be near to God and present to Him, so that nothing may remove him from God—not happiness nor misfortune, nor any creature.

 He \[the text] continues: “Like the full moon in its days.” The moon exercises dominion over all moist nature. The moon is never as close to the sun as when it is full and receives its light directly from the sun. However, because it is closer to the earth than any other star, it has two disadvantages: it is pale and spotted, and it loses its light. It is never as strong as when it is farthest from the earth, for then it causes the sea to ebb the most; the more it wanes, the less it can do this.
 
 The more the soul is elevated above earthly things, the more powerful it is. Whoever recognized nothing but creatures would never think of a sermon, for every creature is full of God and is a book.
 
 A person who wants to reach what has just been spoken of here—this is the whole point of the entire discourse—must be like the morning star: always present to God and always near Him, equally close, raised above all earthly things, and be an attribute to the Word.
{{< /primary >}}





{{< primary >}}
 There is a spoken word—that is the angel, the human, and all creatures. There is another word, thought and spoken; in this, it can happen that I imagine something. Yet there is another word that never ever comes forth; it is rather eternally within the one who speaks it. It is always in a state of being received in the Father who speaks it, and yet it remains abiding.
 
 Rationality works entirely inwardly. The finer and more spiritual a thing is, the more powerfully it works inwardly. And the stronger and finer the rationality is, the more what it recognizes becomes united with it, and the more it becomes one with it.
 
 This is not the case with physical things; the stronger they are, the more they work outwardly.
 
 God’s blessedness lies in the inward working of rationality, where the Word abides.
 
 There the soul should be an attribute and work a single work with God, to grasp its blessedness in the knowledge floating within itself—in that very place where God is blessed.

 That we may always be an attribute to this Word, may the Father, this very Word, and the Holy Spirit help us. Amen.

I want to edn with the following thought 

> The Poetry does not matter, what matters is what the poem points at hwat it allows us to see, feel, and most of all hear. If poetry were ever to reach its goal, fidn at what it aims at, than this would lead anihaltion of poetry.  
> The idea of decreation is imporant,  since The only way we can draw close to the thing itself, is by approaching it from negatives, by using logic of poetry of ascendation and negation, that percede, through contradiction, antitheses and paradox.   
> Disjoint opposite, does not result in anything positive, it is rather through the continious workd of negation that word can point darkly as what surpasses them. The thing itself, can only find voice when words break.
>
> ~ On Mysticism: The Experience of Ectasy.

In the end, the content of meister echkard sermon is not what really matters, what matters is what it aims at, the unintelligible connection with the divine it provides us.
