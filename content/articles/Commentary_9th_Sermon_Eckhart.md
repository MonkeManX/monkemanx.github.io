I have based this commentary on the original German text as published by [Reclam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reclam). The translation is my own, created with the assistance of ChatGPT.

Please note that this is purely my personal interpretation of the sermon. I have no formal training in theology or medieval studies, so my reading should be taken with a grain of salt.

Finally, I should mention that I am more familiar with the Greek philosophical tradition than with traditional Christian scholarship, and this naturally biases my perspective in that direction.

## About Meister Eckhart

[Meister Eckhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meister_Eckhart) was a 13th-century German theologian, Catholic priest, and member of the [Dominican Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order).

He is best known for his sermons, which he delivered in German to lay audiences—an unusual choice at a time when Latin was the standard language of the clergy. His sermons are deeply mystical, characterized by rich and often poetic language. Although he was accused of heresy by the Church, many of the charges were later dropped.


## Sermon 9


{{< primary >}}
"Like the morning star in the midst of the mist and like the full moon in its days and like the shining sun, so did he shine in the temple of God."
Now I hold on to the last word: "temple of God."
What is "God," and what is the "temple of God"?
{{< /primary >}}



The sermon begins with a quote from the [Book of Sirach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Sirach) ([Sirach 50:6](https://biblia.com/bible/douayrheims/sirach/50/6-10)). This book is part of the Catholic Bible but not included in the Protestant canon, so don’t be surprised if you have trouble finding it.

While the passage in Sirach describes the outward appearance of the high priest Simon, son of Onias, Eckhart reinterprets this imagery. He shifts it from something external to a symbol of the inner life. Simon is no longer simply a historical priest, but becomes a figure for the soul enlightened by God. Likewise, the temple is no longer a physical structure, but a representation of the soul itself. This symbolic transposition will become clearer as the sermon progresses.

From this point, Eckhart poses the central question that shapes the rest of the sermon: he seeks to uncover the metaphysical reality of God. Who is God, truly?



{{< primary >}}
Twenty-four masters came together and wanted to speak about what God is. They came at the appointed time, and each presented his statement, of which I now choose two or three.

The first said: "God is something in comparison to which all changeable and temporal things are nothing, and everything that has being is insignificant before Him."
The second said: "God is something that necessarily stands above being, that in itself needs nothing, but is needed by all things."
The third said: "God is a rationality that lives solely through the knowledge of itself."
{{< /primary >}}



Eckhart now gives us three competing definitions of what God could be. The first master definition fits with traditions such as [Anselm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anselm_of_Canterbury), who defined God as the greatest conceivable being.

The third master definition is more in line with the concept of the logos, as formulated by Aristotle and the Stoics. Although the Stoic concept of logos is more on the cosmic level, Aristotle’s conception is more fitting, which can be seen through:

> Therefore Mind thinks itself, if it is that which is best; and its thinking is a thinking of thinking.
>
> ~ Metaphysics, Book 12, 1074b

The second definition is the one Eckhart wants to focus on in his subsequent text. It is clearly inspired by the Neoplatonic thought of "The One":

> And all of these up to the Good are beautiful, but **it itself is above** Beauty and is the transcendent ruler of all that is best, all that is in the intelligible world
>
> ~ Ennead 1.8(51)§1.8.2.

In Neoplatonic thought, the One is identified with God, and everything stems from it. Every being is dependent on it, while it is necessary and not in need of anything. It overflows purely from its own abundance. Furthermore, all things seek to return to the One, because they yearn for it and need it as their source.



{{< primary >}}
I set aside the first and the last and speak of the second, which says that God must necessarily stand above being. Whatever has being, time, or place does not reach up to God—He is beyond it. God is in all creatures insofar as they have being, and yet He is beyond them. The very thing He is in all creatures, He is also beyond them; what is one in many things must necessarily be beyond those things.

Some masters believed that the soul was only in the heart. This is not so, and in this regard great masters have erred. The soul is whole and entire in the foot and entire in the eye and in every single limb.

If I take a segment of time, it is neither today nor yesterday. But if I take the Now, it encompasses all time within itself. The Now in which God created the world is as close to the present time as the Now in which I am now speaking, and the Last Day is as close to this Now as the day that was yesterday.
{{< /primary >}}



Eckhart states: *"He is in all creatures, He is also beyond them;"* — what does he mean by that?

Eckhart believes that God is fundamentally different from everything else that exists. Asking questions like "Where does God exist?" (Place) or "Did God always exist?" (Time) doesn’t make any sense. It's like asking, *"Is the number four blue?"* — a [category error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_mistake). Just as numbers and colors belong to different categories, so too do God, time, and space. God is beyond all of them.

At the same time, Eckhart also believes that God is within everything. This again echoes the Neoplatonic notion of *The One*, where God is like a concentrated force from which everything else emanates. Like a fountain overflowing with water, God overflows and produces creation. Because creation comes from God, it is part of Him. All created things contain a spark of divinity simply by the nature of how they came into existence. This is why Eckhart says *"The soul is whole and entire..."*, here "soul" refers to the divine spark. It is not located in any particular place but is in everything. The soul’s essence is indivisible and unconfined by space.

> How, then, do they[the intelligible world] arise out of aimple One? [...]
>
> In fact, it is because there was nothing in that that all things come from it, and, in order that Being should exist, it is not Being but the gernarot of it. [...]
>
> All these things are the One and not the one; they  are the one, because they are from it; they are not the One, becaue it endowed them with what they are while remaining  by itself."
>
> ~ Ennead 5.2(11)

A similar notion appears in the work of Paul Tillich, who speaks of God as the *Grund* (ground) of being, that which makes existence possible in the first place. God is **becoming**, the power by which something arises from nothing. He gives creation the ability to resist non-being, and through that, becomes part of it.

> The being of God is being-itself. The being of God cannot be understood as the existence of a being alongside others or above others. If God is a being, he is subject to the categories of finitude, especially to space and substance. Even if he is called the “highest being” in the sense of the “most perfect” and the “most powerful” being, this situation is not changed. [...]
>
>  Many confusions in the doctrine of God and many apologetic weaknesses could be avoided if God were understood first of all as being-itself or as the ground of being. [...]
>
>  Therefore, instead of saying that God is first of all being-itself, it is possible to say that he is the power of being in everything and above everything, the infinite power of being.
>
> ~ Paul Tillich, Systematic Theology, Vol 1, Part 2, Chapter 2, B3a)

Lastly, Eckhart’s treatment of time serves to clarify that God is also beyond temporality. God's act of creation is not merely a past event, it is something eternally present. God's “Now” encompasses past, present, and future simultaneously.



{{< primary >}}
 A master says: "God is something that acts in eternity, undivided in itself, that needs no one's help nor any tool, and remains in itself; that needs nothing, yet is needed by all things and to which all things strive as to their ultimate goal."
 This goal has no manner—it grows out of manner and expands beyond it.
 Saint Bernard says: "To love God is manner without manner."

 A physician who wants to heal a sick person has no fixed manner of health in mind, no specific degree to which he wants to make the person well. He certainly has a method by which he wants to heal him, but how healthy he wants to make him—that is without manner: as healthy as he possibly can.

 How much we should love God is subject to no fixed manner; as much as we are able to—that is without manner.
{{< /primary >}}



The idea of God as *“that toward which all things strive as to their ultimate goal”* is a classical Greek doctrine echoed by thinkers like Aristotle, who speaks of God as the *prime mover*: the first in a chain of causal events in his [unmoved mover argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmoved_mover). This concept also appears in Neoplatonism, particularly in Plotinus, who sees the soul as yearning to return to *the One*. This idea is deeply connected to Eckhart’s notion of love for God.

> The soul in its nature loves God and longs to be at one with Him in the noble love of a daughter for a noble father; but coming to human birth and lured by the courtships of this sphere, she takes up with another love, a mortal, leaves her father and falls.
>
> But one day coming to hate her shame, she puts away the evil of earth, once more seeks the father, and finds her peace.
>
> ~ Enneads VI, 6.9(09), §6.9.9

Eckhart does not merely repeat these ideas but adapts them within a Christian framework, in line with theologians like St. Augustine. Consider this famous line from *Confessions*:


> O Lord, and our heart is restless until it rests in you.
>
> ~ Confessions



{{< primary >}}
 Every thing acts according to its being; no thing is capable of acting beyond its being. Fire cannot act outside of wood. God, however, acts beyond being, into the expanse, wherever He is able to move Himself: He acts in non-being. Before there was being, God was already acting. He brought about being when there was no being yet.

 Crude-minded masters say that God is pure being. But He stands as far above being as the highest angel is above a gnat! I would be speaking falsely if I were to call God a being—just as if I were to call the sun pale or black. God is neither this nor that.

 And a master says: whoever thinks he has known God—even if he has recognized something—has not recognized God.

 However, when I have said that God is not a being, but rather beyond being, I have not thereby denied Him being; on the contrary: I have exalted it in Him. If I perceive copper in gold, then it is present, and it is present in a higher way than it is in itself.

 Saint Augustine says: "God is wise without wisdom, good without goodness, mighty without might."
{{< /primary >}}



This again goes back to the notion that calling God a *being* is a category error. Eckhart criticizes theologians like Thomas Aquinas, who famously refers to God as **being itself** with the phrase:

> Ostensum est autem supra, cum de divina simplicitate ageretur, quod Deus est **ipsum esse per se subsistens**.
> (It has been shown above, when treating of the divine simplicity, that **God is being itself subsisting**.)
>
> ~ Summa Theologiae, Prima Pars, Question 44, Article 1

By prescribing certain properties to God, we also limit His power. For example, if we say a table is made of wood, then it cannot be made of stone. Similarly, if we say God is a being, or even *being itself*, then God is bound by the restrictions that apply to beings. Another example of a category error is saying “call the sun pale or black.” One I prefer is: *“Music is delicious.”* We can say music is like a delicious meal, but music is not edible and therefore not delicious. Calling it that would be a category error—a meaningless statement that does not make sense. For more on this, see my article on the [Ontological Argument](/articles/ontological_argument_and_apophatic_theology/#43-limitation-of-god), where I discuss this topic further.

The second part of this section is that just because I can’t say God *is* a being or *is* wise, it does not mean I lessen Him or put Him down. In fact, the opposite is true: by saying God *is* wise or a being, I place God in the same category as humans, but He is far beyond us. Thus, we cannot describe God in human concepts.

That is not to say we cannot talk about God. But just like Eckhart says, when we describe God using human concepts like *Good* or *Wise*, what we do is not state how God really is, but rather use metaphors that attempt to approximate Him—much like saying *“music is delicious.”*

However, Eckhart thinks we can only truly approach God through **negative theology** by describing what God *is not*. For example, God is not being; He is beyond it. God is not wise; He is beyond wisdom.



{{< primary >}}
 Lesser masters teach in schools that all beings are divided into ten modes of being, and they deny all of these to God. None of these modes touches God, yet He lacks none of them either.

 The first, which possesses the most being and from which all things receive their being, is substance; and the last, which contains the least being, is called relation. And this relation is equal in God—the Greatest One, who possesses the most being. They all share the same archetype in God. In God, the archetypes of all things are equal; but they are archetypes of unequal things. The highest angel, the soul, and the gnat all have the same archetype in God.

 God is neither goodness nor being. Goodness adheres to being and is no broader than being; for if there were no being, there would be no goodness, and being is purer still than goodness.

 God is neither good nor better nor best of all. Whoever says that God is good does Him as much injustice as one who would call the sun black.
{{< /primary >}}



The *ten modes of being* refer to Aristotle’s [categories](https://stgb.substack.com/p/aristotles-ten-categories-of-being), which were later adapted by scholastic thinkers like Aquinas:

> Of things said without any combination, each signifies either **substance** or **quantity** or **qualification** or a **relative** or **where** or **when** or **being-in-a-position** or **having** or **doing** or **being-affected**. To give a rough idea, examples of *substance* are man, horse; of *quantity:* four-foot, five-foot; of *qualification:* white, grammatical; of a *relative:* double, half, larger; of *where:* in the Lyceum, in the market-place; of *when:* yesterday, last-year; of *being-in-a-position:* is-lying, is-sitting; of *having:* has-shoes-on, has-armour-on; of *doing:* cutting, burning; of *being-affected:* being-cut, being-burned.
>
> ~ Organon, Categories, 1b25–2a4

All these categories, used in the scholastic tradition to describe everything from apples and chairs to morality and love, simply do **not** apply to God. We cannot say God *has* them, nor can we say God *lacks* them. As Eckhart puts it: *"None of these modes touches God, yet He lacks none of them either."* God is beyond these categories.

When Eckhart speaks about *archetypes*, he means these kinds of Platonic ideas, abstract concepts we derive by stepping back from particular everyday objects to something more general. For example, there are many different apples, but all share the same archetype or Platonic idea of “apple.”

> Well then, here are three beds: one existing in nature, which is made by God, as I think that we may say--for no one else can be the maker?
>
> No.
>
> There is another which is the work of the carpenter?
>
> Yes.
>
> And the work of the painter is a third?
>
> Yes.
>
> Beds, then, are of three kinds, and there are three artists who superintend them: God, the maker of the bed, and the painter?
>
> Yes, there are three of them. [...]
>
> God knew this, and He desired to be the real maker of a real bed, not a particular maker of a particular bed, and therefore He created a bed which is **essentially and by nature one only** [The Form].
>
> ~ Republic, Book 10,  597b–598d

When Eckhart says that this archetype is shared *in* God, he means that these general ideas behind everyday objects come from God—the Platonic ideals reside in God.

Furthermore, there is no hierarchical difference between creatures from God’s perspective: a gnat or an ant is the same as an angel. It doesn’t matter whether it is an ant or an angel—both belong to this world, part of being—but only God is beyond that. In that sense, an ant or an angel are the same to Him.

Just as we cannot ascribe modes of being to God, we also cannot ascribe *goodness* to Him, since goodness is a property or predicate that arises *from* beings. But God transcends being, and thus also transcends goodness.

Therefore, if we say God *is* good, we insult Him, because we pull Him down to the level of ants and angels. Saying *“God is good”* is as wrong as saying *“the sun is black.”*

 Yet God Himself says: “No one is good except God alone.” (Mark 10:18)
 What is good? That which communicates itself. We call a person good who is sociable and beneficial. That is why a pagan master says: “A hermit is neither good nor evil in this sense, for he is neither sociable nor useful.”

 God is the most self-communicating of all. No thing communicates from its own essence, for all creatures are nothing in and of themselves. What they communicate, they have received from another. They also do not give themselves. The sun gives its light and yet remains where it is; fire gives its heat and yet remains fire. But God communicates what is His own, because He is what He is from Himself, and in all the gifts He gives, He first gives Himself.

 He gives Himself as God, as He is, in all His gifts—according to the capacity of the one who is able to receive Him.

 Saint James says: “Every good gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights.” (James 1:17)
{{< /primary >}}



Here, Eckhart addresses a deep theological question:
**If God is truly beyond all being and beyond all categories, including goodness, why does scripture call God “good”?**

To answer this, Eckhart links goodness to **self-communication**. He argues that something is called “good” when it *gives of itself* or *interacts benevolently with others*. This makes sense when we consider the etymology of “morality”, which comes from the Latin *moralis*, meaning something like *pertaining to manners or conduct*—that is, how one acts toward others. So: if goodness is a kind of relational behavior, how can someone be “good” in complete isolation?

This is why God is the **ultimate form of goodness**:

*God is the most self-communicating of all.*
All things come from Him. Everything we share or give to others ultimately has its origin in God. And unlike us, whose giving is separate from our essence (I can give without *being* the gift), God’s essence *is* the act of giving itself.

So in this sense, we humans can *have* goodness as a quality or attribute, while God *is* goodness itself—*not as a moral quality, but as infinite self-giving being*.
At first glance, this seems to contradict Eckhart’s earlier claim that God is beyond all categories, including goodness. But Eckhart would say: **his contradiction is not a flaw—it is the point*.

There are two reasons why this contradiction is essential:

1. **Mysticism thrives on paradox**. When we reach the limits of what language and logic can express, we begin to touch the divine. Only where language fails, where it breaks apart in contradiction, do we start to approach God, who is beyond all form, word, and concept.
2. When we say **“God is goodness,”** we do not mean He fits within our usual human category of goodness. Instead, we mean **He is the source from which all real goodness flows**.
   This is where the analogy helps:

Ice is a form of water, but water is beyond ice: it can be solid, liquid, or gas.
In this way, *goodness is like ice*, and *God is like water*. Goodness *emerges from* God but does not exhaust what God is. God is the source and ground of all goodness, without being *limited* to it.



{{< primary >}}
 When we grasp God in being, we grasp Him in His courtyard, for being is His courtyard in which He dwells. But where is He then in His temple, in which He appears as holy? Rationality is the temple of God. Nowhere does God dwell more truly than in His temple—in rationality, as that other master said: God is a rationality that lives solely in the knowledge of itself, remaining alone in itself, where nothing has ever touched Him, for He alone is there in His stillness.

 God, in the knowledge of Himself, knows Himself in Himself.
{{< /primary >}}



Here we use a spatial metaphor to differentiate between two levels of understanding God:

1. **Courtyard:** We are near the house of God but not inside it, a superficial and indirect knowledge of God. We do not know His true essence.
2. **The Temple:** We are inside God’s house, representing a more intimate knowledge of God.

The first understanding, the *courtyard*, is how God appears to us through His **works**, that is through Scripture (the Bible) and His Creation (nature), which we observe every day. In short, it is knowledge gained through outward experience.

The second, more intimate understanding of God is *in rationality*. Here, *rationality* does **not** mean the kind of logical, argumentative, syllogistic thinking typical of analytic philosophy (e.g., statements like 1 + 1 = 2). Instead, it refers to deep contemplation and mystical experience—shifting from looking outward to looking inward. Think more in line with continental philosophers: rather than harsh logical statements, the truth is found in poetry, music, and beauty. It is a truth more *felt* and *experienced immediately* than deduced.

This rationality is not obtained through outward looking but by turning inward in solitude, “remaining alone in itself”, and stillness, “is there in His stillness.”

The final sentence is tautological, that is, true by definition. This is no accident. It portrays God as completely self-referential and utterly closed to all external grasping—a paradoxical God who is also open, because we can draw near to Him through this self-referential stillness in solitude.

 Now let us consider \[cognition] in the soul, which possesses a tiny drop of rationality, a little spark, a small branch. The soul has powers that operate within the body.

 There is one power through which a person digests; this works more at night than during the day—through it a person grows and gains strength. The soul also has a power in the eye, through which the eye is so sensitive and fine that it does not perceive things in their rawness as they are in themselves; rather, they must first be filtered and refined through the air and the light. This is because the eye has the soul with it.

 Another power is in the soul, with which it remembers. This power forms within itself images of things that are not present, so that I recognize these things just as well as if I were seeing them with my eyes—indeed, even better. I can easily imagine a rose in winter. And with this power the soul operates in non-being, and in doing so it follows God, who also works in non-being.
{{< /primary >}}



Building on the theme of rationality and deep contemplation, at the very core of our being, our soul—there is a spark of divinity given by God.
This divinity cannot be *seen* with our ordinary eyes, the ones we use to perceive everyday objects like chairs, trees, or other people. Instead, to *see* this divinity, we must use our soul and look inward through exhaustive meditation. This divinity is hidden and quiet, “active more at night than by day.”

This idea of an inner divine spark goes back to the Greeks, such as the Stoics:

> God is near you, he is with you, he is within you. This is what I mean, Lucilius: a holy spirit indwells within us, one who marks our good and bad deeds, and is our guardian.
>
> ~ Seneca, Letter XLI: "On the God Within Us"

Additionally, our soul has the power to remember. Here, *see* means the inward perception described above, not ordinary sight. When we see divinity inwardly, we also recognize it as such. This reminds of Plato’s dialogue *Meno*, where he argues that knowledge is nothing other than the soul recalling what it has forgotten:

> The soul, then, as being immortal, and having been born again many times, and having seen all things that exist, whether in this world or in the world below, has knowledge of them all; and it is no wonder that she should be able to call to remembrance all that she ever knew about virtue, and about everything; for as all nature is akin, and the soul has learned all things; there is no difficulty in her eliciting or as men say learning, out of a single recollection all the rest, if a man is strenuous and does not faint; for all enquiry and all learning is but recollection"
>
> ~ Meno, 81d

But the power Eckhart describes with *remembering* goes beyond simple recalling. It is a power to create, to reach into non-being and possibility. It enacts what God does and thus moves beyond what exists. In doing so, it comes closer to God, who Himself is beyond all that exists.

 A pagan master says: “The soul that loves God grasps Him under the veil of goodness.”
 All of what has been mentioned so far are still the words of pagan masters; they recognized nothing except by the natural light. I have not yet reached the words of the holy masters, who recognized in a much higher light.

 This one says: “The soul that loves God, loves Him under the veil of goodness.”
Rationality strips away from God the veil of goodness and grasps Him bare, where He is stripped of goodness, of being, and of all names.
{{< /primary >}}



It is a mistake to try to understand God through human notions of goodness, to “grasp Him under the veil of goodness.” When we impose our limited, human concepts on God, we inevitably fail to see Him as He truly is. This is the stance of a "Pagan Master."

True knowledge of God does not come from conceptualizing or defining Him within familiar categories. Instead, it arises when we love God despite our inability to fully comprehend Him.

Only by suspending all preconceived knowledge and concepts—letting go of what we think we know, and turning inward to the depths of our own being can we begin to encounter God in His true essence. Then, and only then, can we be called a "Holy Master."



{{< primary >}}
 I said in school that rationality is nobler than will, and yet both belong to this \[higher] light. But a master in another school said that will is nobler than rationality, because will takes things as they are in themselves, whereas rationality takes things as they are in itself. This is true. An eye is nobler in itself than an eye painted on a wall.

 But I say that rationality is nobler than will. Will takes God under the garment of goodness. Rationality takes God bare, as He is stripped of goodness and of being. Goodness is a garment under which God is hidden, and will takes God under the garment of goodness. If there were no goodness in God, my will would not desire Him.

 Whoever were to clothe a king on the day of his coronation in gray garments would not have dressed him fittingly. I am not blessed because God is good. I never want to desire that God bless me through His goodness, for He would not be able to do so. I am blessed solely because God is rational and I recognize this.

 A master says: “It is God’s rationality on which the being of the angel wholly depends.”
 One might ask where the being of an image truly resides: in the mirror or in that from which it proceeds. It resides more truly in that from which it proceeds. The image is in me, from me, and toward me. As long as the mirror stands unchanged before my face, my image remains in it; if the mirror falls, the image vanishes.

 The being of the angel depends on the presence of divine rationality, in which he recognizes himself.
{{< /primary >}}



Eckhart differentiates between **rationality** and **will**. Rationality is a deep contemplative focus on the inner essence, a kind of pure knowing. The will, by contrast, is the power of the soul that chooses and desires—it is about longing.

Some say the will of God is better than His rationality because the will sees things as they truly are, unfiltered and direct, while rationality perceives things more like how they appear, less immediate, more mediated.

Eckhart uses the metaphor of an eye to clarify this: the eye represents the will that sees reality directly, while a painting of an eye or its reflection sees the world filtered through artifice or distortion.

However, Eckhart disagrees with the idea that will is superior. He argues that rationality is actually superior because it “takes God bare,” apprehending God in pure nakedness, while will “takes God under the garment of goodness,” meaning it grasps God only through mediated qualities like goodness.

How does this make sense? Shouldn’t it be the opposite—that will, as direct desire, is unfiltered, while rationality is more mediated?

For Eckhart, the will relates to love and desire, which are necessarily connected to the concept of goodness. While will may be more primitive or come before rationality, it is still filtered through what Aristotle calls the “irrational part of the soul” or “animal parts.” Aristotle explains:

> That one element in the soul is **irrational** and one has a rational principle. [...]
> For we praise the rational principle of the continent man and of the incontinent, and the part of their soul that has such a principle, since it urges them aright and towards the best objects; but there is found in them also another element naturally opposed to the rational principle, which fights against and resists that principle.
>
> ~ Nicomachean Ethics, Chapter 13

If we try to grasp God through the will, we always see Him through a lens of desire and thus through goodness (because only godo things can be desired). But God transcends goodness, so we can only understand Him through a more contemplative measure—rationality. Although rationality is also biased, contemplation gives us a chance to recognize and strip away those biases. The will, being more primitive, does not offer that opportunity.

As a metaphor, Eckhart speaks of “clothing a king on the day of his coronation in gray garments,” symbolizing that calling God merely “good” is inadequate and inappropriate, like dressing a King in beggers clothes.

Only when we have stripped God from the “veil of goodness”, that is, when we no longer look at God through human concepts like goodness—can we see Him as He truly is.

Eckhart further illustrates the importance of rationality with the metaphor of angels: the being of angels depends on the presence of divine rationality. They recognize their own being in God’s rationality; thus, angels are like images in a mirror, while God is the source of the image. Without God’s rationality, their being would vanish, just as an image disappears if the mirror falls.

 "Like the morning star in the midst of the fog." I focus on the little word "quasi," which means "just like" or "as if." The children in school call this a "modifier." This is what I have in mind in all my sermons.

 The most essential thing one can say about God is "Word" and "Truth." God called Himself a Word. Saint John said: "In the beginning was the Word" (John 1:1), and he means that there should be a modifier with this Word.

 Just like the "free star," after which Friday is named—the Venus: it has many names. When it rises before the sun and appears earlier than the sun, it is called "the morning star." But when it follows the sun, so that the sun sets earlier, it is called "the evening star." Sometimes it moves above the sun, sometimes below the sun. Among all the stars, it remains constantly near the sun. It never moves farther from or closer to it.

 It stands for a person who wants to reach this goal; such a person should always be near to God and present to Him, so that nothing may remove him from God—not happiness nor misfortune, nor any creature.
{{< /primary >}}



The section begins with a return to the opening of the sermon, citing the Book of Sirach, where the **morning star*:   representing Venus, becomes a symbol for our soul seeking God. Our soul shines bright like the morning star amid confusion and fog.

Eckhart focuses on the word **"quasi"** (“as if” or “like”), emphasizing that whenever he speaks about God, he does **not** describe God as He truly is. Instead, he offers analogies or approximations. This holds true even for his statements about God—they are metaphorical, not literal descriptions.

Continuing the analogy, [Venus is known both as the **morning star** and the **evening star**](https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/venus-morning-star-evening-star), a fact famously used by philosopher Frege when discussing [language, meaning, and reference](paper-summary/on_senses_and_references/) (Though that’s a side note here). Venus always remains close to the sun, never straying far—sometimes below it, sometimes above, sometimes before it, sometimes after it, but always near.

In this metaphor, the **sun** represents God and divinity, and **Venus** represents us—more precisely, our soul. Just as Venus never leaves the sun’s proximity, so too should our soul remain steadfastly close to God.

In other words, **spiritual steadfastness**: the soul’s constant nearness to God, is key.

 He continues: “Like the full moon in its days.” The moon exercises dominion over all moist nature. The moon is never as close to the sun as when it is full and receives its light directly from the sun. However, because it is closer to the earth than any other star, it has two disadvantages: it is pale and spotted, and it loses its light. It is never as strong as when it is farthest from the earth, for then it causes the sea to ebb the most; the more it wanes, the less it can do this.

 The more the soul is elevated above earthly things, the more powerful it is. Whoever recognized nothing but creatures would never think of a sermon, for every creature is full of God and is a book.

 A person who wants to reach what has just been spoken of here—this is the whole point of the entire discourse—must be like the morning star: always present to God and always near Him, equally close, raised above all earthly things, and be an attribute to the Word.

The quote from Sirach continues, introducing the symbol of the **moon**, which represents a **full soul**. Just as the moon receives its light directly from the sun, a full soul is completely open and oriented toward God, reflecting divine illumination.

The stars that are nearer to God symbolize higher beings, such as angels, who remain closer to God’s presence. Compared to them, even if our soul is full and directed toward God, we lose the sun’s light more quickly, illustrating how we stray from God’s path through distractions.

It is often when we are farthest from God—in the sense of detachment from worldly concerns—that we are most spiritually powerful. This represents a distance from mundane affairs and daily troubles.

Detachment is a major theme for Eckhart and earlier thinkers like Plotinus, both emphasizing that closeness to the material world weakens the soul. Plotinus writes:

> In fact, purification would be leaving it [The Soul] alone and not with others [The Senses] or not looking at something else [External Things] and in consequence not having beliefs [Opinions] which are alien to it [Believing Pleasure, Pain of importance] – whatever is the nature of the beliefs or of the affections [Emtions, Desire, Fears, ect.], as has been said – and not looking at images [Fantasies froom Desire] or making affections derived from them.
>
> ~ Ennead 3.6(26)§3.6.5.

All creatures have God within them, but spiritual insight arises only when one focuses on the divine. Like the morning star that forever hovers near the sun, we too should hover near God, high above the earth and its desires.

 There is a spoken word—that is the angel, the human, and all creatures. There is another word, thought and spoken; in this, it can happen that I imagine something. Yet there is another word that never ever comes forth; it is rather eternally within the one who speaks it. It is always in a state of being received in the Father who speaks it, and yet it remains abiding.

 Rationality works entirely inwardly. The finer and more spiritual a thing is, the more powerfully it works inwardly. And the stronger and finer the rationality is, the more what it recognizes becomes united with it, and the more it becomes one with it.

 This is not the case with physical things; the stronger they are, the more they work outwardly.

 God’s blessedness lies in the inward working of rationality, where the Word abides.

 There the soul should be an attribute and work a single work with God, to grasp its blessedness in the knowledge floating within itself—in that very place where God is blessed.

God is often associated with the **Word** in Christianity and with the **Logos** in ancient Greek philosophy, both meaning the same, *Logos* being Greek for *word*.

> In the beginning the **Word** already existed.
>    The Word was with God,
>    and the Word was God.
> He existed in the beginning with God.
> God created everything through him,
>    and nothing was created except through him.
> The Word gave life to everything that was created,
>    and his life brought light to everyone.
>
> ~ John 1:1-4


> Of this *logos* which holds always, humans prove to be uncomprehending, both before they hear it and after hearing it for the first time.
> For although all things come to be in accordance with this *logos*, they are like the unexperienced experiencing words and deeds such a I explain when I distinguish each thing according to its nature and show how it is.
> Other men are unaware of what they do when they are awake just as they are forgetful of what they do when they are asleep.
>
> ~ Heraclitus, Fragment B1

This word, *Logos*, can be separated into three levels:

1. **Spoken outwardly:** These are angels, humans, and all other creatures. They are *spoken* in the sense that they are created by God.
2. **Thought and spoken:** This is the imaginative world, which we can think of as *spoken* in this sense.
3. **The Word that never comes:** This is the eternal and unchanging world of the Word/*Logos*. It does not exist in our reality or world but exists only in eternal unity in God, "eternally within the one who speaks." It is always in a state of "becoming," as Paul Tillich would say, "always in a state of being received."

We come closer to the good, *the Word that never comes*, by looking inward through *thought and spoken*, because "God's blessedness lies there", not in the outward physical things *spoken outwardly*. We should engage in this inward looking through rationality, in a contemplative and meditative process.

Our souls should not be merely servants of God but an attribute of Him; we should participate in God's own being. This reminds us of other mystics who speak of a deep union with God:

> I saw no difference between God and our substance: but as it were all God; and yet mine understanding took that our substance is in God: that is to say, that God is God, and our substance is a creature in God.
>
> ~ Revelations of Divine Love, The Fourteenth Revelation, Chapter 54

 That we may always be an attribute to this Word, may the Father, this very Word, and the Holy Spirit help us. Amen.

I want to end with the following thought:

> Poetry itself does not matter; what matters is what the poem points to—what it allows us to see, feel, and most of all, hear. If poetry were ever to fully reach its goal, to find precisely what it aims at, this would lead to the annihilation of poetry.
> The idea of decreation is important, since the only way we can draw close to the thing itself is by approaching it through negatives, by using the logic of poetry—of ascension and negation—that proceeds through contradiction, antitheses, and paradox.
> Disjointed opposites do not result in anything positive; rather, it is through the continuous work of negation that words can point darkly toward what surpasses them. The thing itself can only find voice when words break.
>
> ~ On Mysticism: The Experience of Ecstasy

In the end, the content of Meister Eckhart’s sermon is not what truly matters; what matters is what it aims at, the unintelligible connection with the divine that it provides us.
