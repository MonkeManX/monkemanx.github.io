When we dream, we are not aware of it, we are not in control of it. When we wake up the next day and rmemeebr the dream it is like wacthing a film,
it is almost like the dream did not happen to you, but someone else. But there is a state of mind, where it feelsl ike th dream is our own and nobody
else and that is lucid dreaming. It is when druing the dream were are in full contrrol of what we are doing, it is not like in a
cinema where things happen to you, but you are the ressigeur and the actor at once.
But how does this lucid dreaming occur?
In my teenage years, driven by the sexual lust of a boy full of hormones, I tried for multiple weeks to
make the dream of sexual conquest in the most literaly meaning of the word come true and what better way then with lucid dreams?
As it turns out there is set of practises that you can do, that done regular increases thel ikelihood of lucid dream drastically.
All these practises rely on the same principle to lucid dream, you need to become aware in the dream that you are dreaming, and to do
taht you need to somehow notice that what you are currently expeirncing is weird and surreal and cannot be realiity.
There are many different ways to do this, one can even use multiple techniques to increase the liekrlihood even further , but they all rely on  then otion
of relizing that soemthing is off with your current experincing and deduce that you are dremaing.
Some things that remain universaly true across all dreams, is that clocks look wierd they say impossible times, have too manyn umbers on it,
or have too manyp ointers, another things that is even moreu niversal are your hands, i nreality we have alwys 5 fingers, this is not the case
in dreams (in this aspects it does seem  that technology mimics nature, as ai models also stuggel with correct dipciture of fingers), i ndreams
you have often too many or too ltile fingers. If in a dream we can notice either of the two, we can become aware thta we are dreaming and thus
the dreams turns into a lucid dream. But how can we gurantee that we notice this in a dream?
The simple answer is through habbit, through making it a regular practise, say every hour to check how many fingers oyu have or looking at the clock and
checking if anything is weirs, and continue this for some days or weeks it will become inrgained into you to until you subconciosu will do it in dreams to.
That this works is not only confrimeed by studies, but I can also confirm myself as not a week after starting this practise I had my first lucid dream.

But what interests me now, is why this practise seems to produce lucid dreams in the frist place? Why is it, that when we become aware that we are currently in a dream,
we are thrust from the a memeber of the audience in a cinema right into the film itself, becomign the ressiguer and acotr at once?

One possible answer might be that the ego tries to reconfirm itself. All we humans have the ability of diascoitation, where we put some thoughs, emotional states
or parts of us in drawer, this is often done subcnsiously for example if a child experiences abuses but also in more mundance cases, for exmapel
in te morning ou had a bad fight with your partner and before going going to work you disacotiate from it, this does not mean what is put in drwaer does no effect us,
childhood drama often determines parts of our personaltiy even we we are uncincious of it, even if we diacioate the figt with the partner it might sitll effect us at work
we snap easier eaiser when annnoyed are more restless and so on. In extremse cases such as multiple perosnaltiy disorder, this disaciton can be entire alters i.e. persoanlities.

What does this have to do with lucid dreams?

In a reprevious artilce i already have discussed how hard ti is to find soemthing that seprates [waking person for mdremaing person](/articles/killing_dream_people/), one possible
interpretation of the dremaing people are that of a disacotion, the reaon why we do not feel like we arei n control of the perosn in the dream is because they are disacotiated form
us, from our ego where the ego is the part of that we identify with "self" or "I", and when we wake up we can soemtime remmeebr and sometimes not just like other diaciton liek childhood
drama sometimes it bulbles up in oru concious and sometiems not.
