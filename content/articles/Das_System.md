Outline:
- What is philosophy? What is its puprose
    - betrand russel quote
    - differnet modern views philosophy
    - goign back to the nacient socrates: philosophy for how to live
       -  for that we need a philsophcial system
- What is a philosophical sysetm?
    - needs to answer to question
        - what is
        - waht ought
    - why these two questions?
       - man is a being of action
           - action nesseciates: a wish(normativie), knowledge that the aciton will elad to fullfillemnt of wish (knowslegde, descirptive)
           - what ahppens if one element ism iising?
- Structure of text
    - benefeficial to start with what is because form that will follow what ought (for mis doesnt follow no ough we will coem to that)
- What is morality?
    - Morality means hwo shoudl we treat each other, what do we owe each other?
    - Where does this owe coem form? why do i owe someone what? I did not do any conrtact with anybody? where else doesm roality then coem from
    - Evulitonary spekaing mrolaits is beneficial as groups with mroality liek do notk ill had betetr harmony, betetr group cohesive, did trust eahc other, coudl rely omn eahc other, conduciveness to survivial.
    - From this our core moral intution devloped, in that sense morality is emtoivism, when we say do not mruder we say mruder boo we express an emotion and meotion that delvoped because of evolutionary preasure
    - over time mroe and mroe came otgetehr and oru basic moral was no logner neough, additonal mroal ruels had to come, but where do we get them? we cant just aritifcal delvope them liek the corem roality.
    - Constructivism, as society we made ruels what is mroaly acceptible in our sosciety and if people adhere to them they where rejected for msociety, this helped that alrger society works, so when we say mruder is wrong we mean, if you do murder you violate the soscietal contract
    - over time tthis too became through societal reinforcmeent part of our culture and entrangled with oru emtoions
    - so thta its hard to say nowadays what is core and what came later, they melted togetehr and now when we say mruder is wrogn we mean both mruder booh and you violate societal conract
    - importantly this set of core mroality si the same for human groups tat evolved togetehr and different for not, and the societal the smae for soceityasl
        - this epxlains why it seem we humans share a lot of core morlaity but not all, and societal sharen ot a lot of mroe auxilery morlaity
    - There is one more aspect to what morlaity is, that is that this conrtactisalism gets always renmogtiated, peopel try to inteerllectualize what morlaity is to find out what moral is and thus try to find principles and then generalize them e.g. sufferign is bad, virtue is good, ..., imporatnly this is exactly backward from how morality devloped
        - example animal suffering: evolutionary there is no big advnatage to consider naimal morality, when we now try to work backwards form principles like suffeirng is bad, animal suffer, thus animal have mroality, we workd backwards and thats why it seems weird.
    - As such from that different framework or mdoels have devloped on how to udnerstand morlaity all trying to cpature what mroality is by principlizing it all ahving beenfits and disavanategs of it, no mdoel workign perfect capturing different aspect of it e.g. virtue ehtics, ulteirnaism, dnetology
    - perosnality i like the virtue ehtics mdoel to udnertsand mroality
        - expalin why
- But so far we have only talekd what mroality is and how it delvoepd, but so far we have no normaitive thrust, we have just epxlaiend what is not what ought.
    - Nietszche cultural mroality no nrioamtive thrusat
- We will coem back to the question of ought later, frist wee need to look at metaphysicvs i.e. epxlain what the world is made fo in it most inenrst
    - analytical idealism
        - physikalism is wrong e.g. what is it liek to be a bat
        - all we now is phenomenal i.e. mental
        - minimum assumption possible everything else is amde of mind
    - heideeger
        the problem why there is normative thrust in mrolaity os far, is because we have seprated obejctivity for msubejctivity
        - but meanign and with that mnroality arises from subjectivity, by seperatign objetivity andu bjectivity, and tring to epxlain subejctibvity from obejctivy we remove that what we want to epxlain see what is itl iek to eb a bat
            - e.g. Do animals have beliefs? stephen stich
        - By reocgnitto nthat everythign is menatal and with that animals alnd all other aren ot different to we, we realize that we are not different in kind but only in degree of mental/conciosuness fro motehr things
        - the only thign weh ave direct acess it ourselves, and we know intimitely the pehenomenal charasteriicis of pain and with that si bad and can generelize this and unvierlize thsi that pain in other htigns also bad, trhoguh a kidn of comadery in sufferen see shcopenahuer
        - now comes then romative thrust, we knoww that we are same as other, we knwo that other expeirencep ain, we know that pain is bad, hecne nromative we should avoid pain and inflciting it ot other who also have pain
            - that does not mean we need to be stuck i nepxeirnce machine, soemtime the pehenomencla chastericis of soemthign good can outweigth the abdness of pain which oems with it e.g. rainign with weights
            - how doesn ormativity arise?
                - by simply living in the wordl we will intercat with it be aprt of it and nroamtivite wil lnatural come to us dpeending on how and where we grew up see heidegger
