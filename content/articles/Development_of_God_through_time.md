In this article I want to explore the philosophical evolution of the ceoncept of God.
How it got started thousnad of years ago and how it evolved over time due both scientific and philosophical criticism.

## Introduction 


## 5 Phases of God

1. Animism (Pre-theistic)
2. Polytheism (Mythological Systems)
3. Monotheism (Classical Theism)
4. Apophatic (Negative Theology) 
5. Process (Ground of Possibilities)
