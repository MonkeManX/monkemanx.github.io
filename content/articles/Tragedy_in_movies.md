## 1. Introduction

Yesterday I was lying in my bed and I didnt want to sleep yet, whcih was no problem sicne I had at least 40 minutes to spare before  I *really* needed to sleep to wake up inviogorated the next day.
But I din't want to doomscrool, read some irelwant news, or watch some __ video, I was hugnering for something more, something that afetr you have consumed stays with you and does not leave you like the short ephermeal taste of sweets, and for me where I find such things are always stories, good story stay with you long time, great stories your whole lifetime, they are meaningful.

So for 20 minutes I was looking for some story that piqued my interest but everything seemed so dull, unauthenthic and clische. Until I found the manga "After Gods", the cover and then syncopsis grabbed me and didnt loose me until it was far far late when I wanted to got sleep.
So I was wondering, what made this story so grabbing for me?  It wasnt the beatufil drawn art, it wasnt the dialogue that was funny and witty at times and it wasnt even the overaching story. It was the tragic(synonm needed) aspect of it. And thinking back all my favourite stories could be classified as tragedies or at least have very heavy tragic aspect to it. From webnovels like i shall seal the heaven, renedgade immortal, necroepilogos or even magical insman, movies like synendoch in new york, angels egg or leyla forever, to anime like ...

What is this attraction that draws us human to these stories (or not), like moths to a flame?

Altough I have not all the answeres, I want to provide at least one anylsises that might illuminate some aspects of it.


## 2. Aspeectss of stories

The birht of tragedjy is one of the most famous work of the philosophers Nietszche in which as the titlem ight suggest he gives an account for where tragejdy comes from more precisely where greek tragedjy comes from, altough the title has also a second meaning we will epxlore later in some more details.

For nietzsche human nature is made of two parts the first he calls apollo after the greek god of ___ the second he calls dionias afetrt he greek god of wine and festivals. Both are present in every human and all their derivatvie works. So what are these two aspects? The aspects can be through of polar opposite with Apollo represent thigns like structure, order, logic, kidness, morality, clearness, serenity. While disonian represent unstrucutre, unorder, emotions, cruelty, orgies, immorality, murkyness, suffering.

How does this play out i nreality?

Apollo is the clear and logical beauty of mathathmathic, the elegant and simple formulas and shapes. Apollo is the structured and rthmic music of ___
Disyonias is intoxication of the wine at a part, the dancing, the wildness, Disyonias is the usntructed music of experimental genre.

And altough I applied this analyis to art, this can be made with all things created by humans, toolsl ike an hammer with clear purpose are apollo, mass gatehrings in stadium and rvae parties are disynoais.

In most cses this is not really as cut clear as i made it out ot be, every thing made byh umans lies on a spectrum between apollo ad disonian some have more of one aspect some more of the others.

We can make a similar anylssis for genre of stories like movies or novels. Altough this doesn ot work for all genres, genres like scifi or fantasy that describe more of a setting than a story (altough some people might disagree with hthis charcterization) cannot be clearly classified to either of the two aspects, because they are neutral in that aspect and tell more where teh story takes place, then what is going to happen.

## 3. The Birth of Tragedjy

Earlier i talked about how the tile of nietszc the book brith of tragedjy besises it obvious menaing has a second more "hidden" meaning that only becomes visible afterh aving read the book.
And that is instead of refering to how tragdies are born more general, it refers to the birth of a very specific tragedjy and that is the loss of tragedies in our modern world.

Not only in media tragedjy has become lost but also in our day to day life
 - death was all around us
    - medicine
