Disconnected
Reality seems so far away
I wish lain was here.

{{< poem >}}
Individuals,
Weak, sad, hopeless and alone--
Wire welcomes you all,
Realize! Let's all love Lain!
Realize! We are all Lain!
{{< /poem >}}


{{< poem >}}
Minds together altered state.
Through the Wire - always linked.
While back empty, just now full
Our milieu, System Lain.
{{< /poem >}}

{{< poem >}}
Quickly, Slowly
Gently, Roughly
Forward, Backward
Upward, Downward
Graceful, Wasteful
Joyful, Woeful
No matter how--
Save me, Lain!

{{< poem >}}
Fleshbags - false and foul,
real in 3d; without wit
the wire miss them not!
