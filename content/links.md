Back when the Internet was just getting started, the web was highly decentralized, consisting of many unique websites often operated by a single individual or a small group, each displaying its own distinct personality, not only in style but also in content.

Nowadays, the web is far more centralized. When one searches the Internet, they most likely do it on "Google," which directs them to "YouTube" for videos, "Instagram" for personal images, and "Quora" or "Reddit" for questions.

Gone is the era when each click to a website felt exciting and full of life, now replaced by a sterile, artificial, corporate look full of trackers and [hostile to their netizens](https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/). I, for one, try to follow the [Brutalist design](https://brutalist-web.design/) for most of this website.
