This paper originally included a section on linguistics, examining how the words *deliberate*, *intended*, and *purposeful* are used in language, including their etymology and grammatical functions. However, I left that section out.

## 0. Introduction

When we talk about **responsibility** in the context of action, we need to establish whether someone acted **freely** or not. To determine this, it is helpful to examine not only the conditions that excuse an action, but also the kinds of words that **intensify** responsibility.

Three key terms are:

* **Intend** – Did the person *intend* the action?
* **Purpose** – What was the *purpose* behind the action?
* **Deliberate** – Did the person *deliberate* before acting?

For example, if a teacher sees a child spilling ink all over their desk, they might ask:

* “Did you *intend* to spill the ink?”
* “What were you thinking when you did this?”
* “Why did you do this—what was your *purpose* in spilling all this ink?”

At first glance, these questions seem to be asking the same thing or at least pointing toward the same issue. But is that really the case?


## 1. Word Delimitation

Let’s explore these distinctions through examples.

Imagine I stretch a cord across the top of a staircase, and later an elderly woman trips over it and dies. We wouldn’t ask if I *intended* her death, or if I had a *purpose* in her tripping—some things seem impossible to do without intention or purpose.

Suppose I needed money for betting on horse races. I take cash from the register, fully *intending* to return it once I win. The *intention* is clear—but what about the *purpose*? Was my purpose to return the money? No—it was to *use* the money for betting.

Now imagine I come home and find broken glass on my doorstep. I throw it onto the sidewalk. It seems obvious I *intended* to do that—I knew what a sidewalk was. But was that my *purpose*? Did I do it *deliberately*?

Or take a case where, in the heat of a fight, I impulsively punch someone. That action would not be *deliberate*, but it still happened with *intention*. So, it is possible to act **with intention** but **without deliberation**.

Consider a group of kids who go around damaging trees. Their acts may be *deliberate*, but did they have a *purpose*? Or when kids burn ants with a magnifying glass—did they have a *goal* in mind? Perhaps not, yet the acts were certainly *intentional*. So, we can act **with intention** but **without purpose**.

Now picture this: I’m in my car, about to leave my driveway, when I get a call that my daughter has been hospitalized. I see the neighbor’s bike in my path. I know I should stop and move it, but in my panic, I decide to drive over it. In this case, the action was **deliberate**, but not **intended**—I didn’t *mean* to damage the bike, but I knowingly chose not to avoid it.

This brings to mind phrases like **“accidentally on purpose”**—a way to describe something done *without clear intention*, but with *some kind of purpose* in mind. Here, we have an act that is **purposeful**, but not **intended**.


## 2. Definition

The most difficult term here is **intended**. As we go through life, we usually have a sense of what we are trying to do. We rarely “discover” what we did *after* the fact. Acting with intention often involves a **plan**, and the concept of intention is closely tied to this. For example, saying “I intended to eat dinner tonight” rules out the idea that it could happen unintentionally.

The function of words like *intended* is to **bracket** an action—to define its scope. For instance, when a thief says he *intended* to return the money he stole, he is asking us to evaluate the **whole arc** of the action, not just the act of theft.

The word **purpose**, on the other hand, refers to the **goal** or **end** we aim at. It is the result we *want* to bring about through our action—but it’s not necessary to have a purpose in order to act. Many actions are intentional but purposeless.

Finally, an action is **deliberate** if we pause to think before doing it—asking ourselves, “Should I do this or not?” If, after reflection, we choose to act, then the act is *deliberate*.
