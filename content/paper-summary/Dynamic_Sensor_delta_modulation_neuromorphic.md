**Paper Title:** A Dynamic Vision Sensor With 1% Temporal Contrast Sensitivity and In-Pixel Asynchronous Delta Modulator for Event Encoding

**Link to Paper:** https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7128412

**Date:** 21 May. 2025

**Paper Type:** Neuromorphics, Sesnor, Circuits

**Short Abstract:**
In this paper, the authors showcase an event-driven sensor that uses [Delta modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_modulation). The sensor is subsequently used in various robotic tasks and performs well.

## 1. Introduction

Event-driven sensors transform real-world analog signals into asynchronous electrical event sequences.
These sensors can be used as input for either algorithms or hardware processing in neuromorphic systems, which have become increasingly popular due to their power efficiency and speed in processing information.

One such sensor is the Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), which encodes changes in light contrast into events.
One of the most important metrics for such a sensor is **temporal contrast (TC)**, defined as the detection threshold across which a TC signal can elicit an event.
In this paper, the authors develop a sensor that improves performance to achieve 1% sensitivity in TC detection.
