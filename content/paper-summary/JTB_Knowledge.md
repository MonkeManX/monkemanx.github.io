**Paper Title:** Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?

**Date:** June 1963     
**Paper Type:** Philosophy, Epistomology    
**Short Abstract:**   
In this paper Gettier Shows that Justified True Belief does not consitute Knowledge.  


There have been many attempts to define what **knowledge** is. One such attempt is called **Justified True Belief (JTB)**, which can be stated as follows:

> A subject S **knows** proposition P if and only if:  
> (i) P is true;  
> (ii) S believes that P;  
> (iii) S is justified in believing that P.

First and foremost, for any proposition P, if S is justified in believing P, and P entails Q, and S can deduce Q from P and accept Q, then S is also justified in believing Q.

With this in mind, let’s look at the following scenario:

Suppose that Smith and Jones have applied for a certain job, and suppose further that Smith has strong evidence for the following proposition:  

**(a)** Jones is the man who will get the job, and Jones has ten coins in his pocket.

Thus, Smith is justified in believing (a). Furthermore, (a) entails:  

**(b)** The man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket.

Since (a) is justified and (b) logically follows from it, (b) is also justified.

Now, suppose—unknown to Smith—that Jones will not get the job. Instead, Smith will. Also unbeknownst to Smith, he himself has ten coins in his pocket.

Then Smith **knows** (b), because:  
(i) (b) is true — Smith gets the job and has ten coins;  
(ii) Smith believes (b);  
(iii) Smith is justified in believing (b).

According to the Justified True Belief definition, we would have to say that Smith **knows** (b). However, intuitively, we would say that Smith does **not** know it, because his belief was based on false premises. Such examples are called **Gettier cases**.

Thus, *Justified True Belief* cannot be a proper definition of knowledge.

Suppose John is standing at a train station and looks at the clock to find out what time it is. The clock shows 3 p.m., and it is, in fact, really 3 p.m.  
According to the JTB definition, John knows that it is 3 p.m., because conditions (i)–(iii) are fulfilled.

But here’s the twist: the clock is actually broken and only **by chance** shows the correct time.  
In this case, we wouldn’t say John *knew* that it was 3 p.m.—he just got lucky.
