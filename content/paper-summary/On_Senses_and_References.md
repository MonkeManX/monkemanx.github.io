**Paper Title:** On Senses and References  
**Link to Paper:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_reference  
**Date:** 1892  
**Paper Type:** Philosophy, Philosophy of language  
**Short Abstract:**  
Thematizes the problem in the pfilosophy of language, where it sometimes seems that we have two terms that have different meaning even tough they reference the same objects.

If we have the two statements \(a = a\) and \(a = b\), then the former is *a priori* true, by definition of \(=\), and doesnt seem to provide new information, menawhile the later statement provides new information and it is not trivial true.

But if we now assume that both statements would be true, then they would have the same meaning, because \(a = b = a\).
But this would be then strange, because that would mean that the meaning of \(a = b\) is that the characters of 'a' and 'b' have the same meaning.

thus he differentiates bewtenn sinn udn bedueutng explain what, 

important the sinn is not paritcular a spatial component e.g. plato has the sense of teacher of arisotele, writer of rebuplic, student of socrates, and they have all different sinn, but are not spatial/perspective.

1. Suppose the meaning of linguistic expressions consists solely in their referent.
2. The expressions "the evening star" and "the morning star" have the same referent (Venus).
3. Therefore: The expressions "the evening star" and "the morning star" have the same meaning.
4. Two expressions that have the same meaning also make the same contribution to the meaning of sentences in which they occur.
5. Therefore, "the evening star" makes the same contribution to the meaning of the sentence  
(A) "The evening star is the morning star"  
as the expression "the morning star" makes to the meaning of the sentence  
(M) "The morning star is the morning star".
6. The expression "Â· is the morning star" makes the same contribution to the meaning of sentences (A) and (M).
7. The meaning of a sentence is fully determined by the contribution of its components.
8. Therefore, the sentences (A) and (M) have the same meaning.
9. If two sentences have the same meaning, they have the same cognitive value.
10. Therefore, the sentences (A) and (M) have the same cognitive value.
11. However, the sentences (A) and (M) have different cognitive values: the former is informative and knowable a posteriori, the latter is uninformative and knowable a priori.
12. Therefore, assumption (1.) is false.

With sinn we do not mean the inner vorstellugn davon, ebcause than language would be subjective, but language is for communciation thus we couldnt properly ommunicate thigns to each other.

sinn bedueutng nowdays we clal it extensional and intensional, extensional referes to the set of object that have this property, e.g. we have lebenwesne with hearts and nieren, aber alle lebenswense die herzen habe nauch neiren udn andersrum, this means they are extensional the same, intensional(?)

we can have things thav have sinn  but no bedeutung e.g. odyseus, but the opposite is not true

one can understand the sinn as connecting the character with its refernceobject, in other word if we have a character like 'morgenstern' what conects it to the object it referneces and that is the sinn. Because if we hadnt a sinn, than we could ask ourselves how or what makes teh connect between teh character and the ferenceo bject.

when we do deifniton we want extensional to be the same, but the intensional should be different, else we would have exatcly the same object, in a definiton thats what we trying to do to define an object by finding a more simpler intensional.
