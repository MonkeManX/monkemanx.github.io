I am a Computer Science student currently studying at the *Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany*, with an interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially in understanding how knowledge representation and multi-modularity can enhance the capabilities of intelligent agents.



{{< details "My Positions" "false" >}}

This section provides an overview of my positions on various topics. By "positions," I mean knowledge or beliefs that I consider likely to be true, though they are more speculative in nature rather than purely factual.

This section is a work in progress, and I will add entries to it whenever I write a relevant article. Furthermore, for most topics, I do not have time to explore every position in detail. As such, I have a strong bias towards the positions Iâ€™ve read about most thoroughly.


## Philosophy

**Metaphilosophy**
- Why care about philosophy? A: [Philosophical assumptions and better conversations](/articles/metaphilosophy)
- What is the aim of philosophy? A: [Philosophy as a model](/articles/metaphilosophy)

**Value Theory**  
- What do we *value*? A: [Capability to deploy consciousness](/articles/when_does_a_something_deserve_moral_considerations/)

**Ethics**  
- What does *ought* mean? A: [Ought as an outdated concept](/articles/the_meaning_of_ought/)
- What is *morality*? A: [Fictionalism with a bit constructivism](/articles/metaethical_position/)
- How shoud one *act* to be moral? A: [Virtue Ethics](/articles/aristotele_virtue_ethics/)

**Epistemology**
- What is *knowledge*? A: [Contextualism](/articles/what_is_knowledge/)

**Metaphysics**
- Do we have *free will*? A: [No](/articles/about_freedom/#4-what-about-free-will)

**Aesthetics**
- What is *love*? A: [The desire to attain beauty and goodness and preserve them forever](/articles/symposium/)

## Artificial Intelligence 

**Road to AGI**     
Symbolic AI will not lead us to AGI, as it doesn't seem feasible to write enough rules to cover every possible intelligent behavior pattern. Instead, the current data-driven paradigm using deep learning, in combination with some form of reinforcement learning, will be needed. Deep learning provides the world model, while reinforcement learning allows the agent to act upon the world model and refine it, through a feedback loop, as layed out by *active inference*.
