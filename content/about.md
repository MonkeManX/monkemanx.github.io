I am a Computer Science student currently studying at the *Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany*, with an interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially in understanding how knowledge representation and multi-modularity can enhance the capabilities of intelligent agents.


{{< details "My Positions" "false" >}}

This section provides an overview of my positions on various topics. By "positions," I mean knowledge or beliefs that I consider likely to be true, though they are more speculative in nature rather than purely factual.

This section is a work in progress, and I will add entries to it whenever I write a relevant article. Furthermore, for most topics, I do not have time to explore every position in detail. As such, I have a strong bias towards the positions I’ve read about most thoroughly.

## Philosophy

**Metaphilosophy**
- Why care about philosophy? A: [Philosophical assumptions and better conversations](/articles/metaphilosophy)
- What is the aim of philosophy? A: [Philosophy as a model](/articles/metaphilosophy)
- Do philosophical concepts have essences? A: [No essences, only relations](/articles/against_essentialism/)

**Value Theory**
- What deserves *moral consideration*? A: [Capability to deploy consciousness](/articles/when_does_a_something_deserve_moral_considerations/) and [Capacity to experience Suffering](/tangled_thoughts/philosophical_ramblings_pain_conciousness_animals/)
- What do we *value*? A: [Value arises from Subjectivity](/articles/where_the_eiffel_tower_is_is_not_obejctive/).

**Ethics**
- What does *ought* mean? A: [Ought as an outdated concept](/articles/the_meaning_of_ought/)
- What is *morality*? A: [Fictionalism with a bit constructivism](/articles/metaethical_position/)
- How should one *life* i.e. *act*? A: [Virtue Ethics](/articles/how_to_live/)

**Epistemology**

- How do we *talk* about God? A: [We can't](/articles/ontological_argument_and_apophatic_theology/)

## Artificial Intelligence

**Road to AGI**
Symbolic AI will not lead us to AGI, as it doesn't seem feasible to write enough rules to cover every possible intelligent behavior pattern. Instead, the current data-driven paradigm using deep learning, in combination with some form of reinforcement learning, will be needed. Deep learning provides the world model, while reinforcement learning allows the agent to act upon the world model and refine it, through a feedback loop, as layed out by *active inference*.

{{< details "History of Believes" "false" >}}

This section notes believes that I do not longer hold and why.

## Philosophy


* Do *Categories/Universals* exist?
  * Old: No, I am a [Fictionalist](/articles/metaethical_position/#fictionalism) Nominalist.
  * New: Ontically, they exist. Ontologically, I am not sure. See Heidegger.
* Is there an *agentic/non-agentic* God?
  * Old: [No, agentic God](/articles/nature_of_god/), [Maybe, non-agentic God](/paper-summary/ground_of_being/)
  * New: I believe that God is beyond all categories, including logic—and that also includes being beyond the category of being agentic. See C.S. Lewis, *Mere Christianity*.
* Does the concept of *Trinity* make sense?
  * Old: [No](/articles/ontological_argument_and_apophatic_theology/#41-jesus-perfection-argument)
  * New: The Trinity is not an analytical concept, but a synthesis of the experience of God in Jesus as God Himself, and of oneself as the Holy Spirit. God, being beyond categories, also transcends being a single identity in the usual sense. See C.S. Lewis, *Mere Christianity*.
