I’m just gonna say this like it is—[Hunger and Pain](https://archiveofourown.org/works/51652651/chapters/130569238) from Ao3 is peak fiction. No, I will not elaborate.   
Be warned, though—it is sometimes cringy, and they do kill each other, cannibalize each other, and find, let’s just say, very creative ways to fuck each other—metaphorically and not metaphorically.
