It has Ryan Gosling (oh my gosh, he's literally me) and Bryan Cranston (the Breaking Bad guy, Waltuh), and both do a phenomenal job with their acting. I really like the character Ryan Gosling plays, stoic and autistic with a hint of sadness. The movie also features all the meme songs, which I enjoy. The movie itself isnâ€™t particularly deep, but the action and characters are amazing. 8/10
