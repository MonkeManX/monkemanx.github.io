I have no idea what I just watched.

Amazing non-traditional soundtrack consisting of chants with classical and ambient elements. It doesn’t follow the modern anime style; instead, it has a unique look, which I appreciate. The color palette is also worth noting. It’s extremely cold, with many dark tones and shades. Only a few things in the movie have warmer colors, like the heroine and her companion. The movie feels very desolate and lonely—the streets of the city are empty and abandoned. When we do see other people, they resemble stone statues, more automata than human. 7/10. 

**EDIT 1:** Because of this [Inerpretation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFy8cn9TlZc&t=939) "Angles Egg as Religious Crisis" up the score to 8/10.

**EDIT 2:** Another [interpretation](https://rodrovich.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/angels-egg-a-surreal-engrossing-and-ambiguous-visual-discussion-on-faith-existentialism/). Very roughly, the movie can be interpreted through the lens of the central question in Kierkegaard’s *Either/Or*: faith and reason are fundamentally incompatible, and one must ultimately choose between them.   
The girl takes a leap of faith and chooses to believe. The boy, faced with a desolate world and the apparent absence or abandonment of God, chooses reason instead.   
A bit more symbolically, the fishermen running around the city with their harpoons, chasing a giant fish, represent people attempting to use reason to pursue faith and God. But this is a hopeless task—faith that relies on reason ceases to be true faith, and so they drown.   
The egg symbolizes the hope of faith in God and the coming of Jesus. In the final scene, when the girl falls from the cliff, it represents her taking the ultimate leap of faith. In her death, many more eggs appear, signifying the spreading of hope and belief. In the final scene, we see that all the people who believed, including the girl, are saved by God—leaving the boy behind. 9/10.
