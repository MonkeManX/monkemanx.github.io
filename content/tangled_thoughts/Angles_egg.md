I have no idea what I just watched. If somebody knows, please send me an email.

Amazing non-traditional soundtrack consisting of chants with classical and ambient elements. It doesn’t follow the modern anime style; instead, it has a unique look, which I appreciate. The color palette is also worth noting. It’s extremely cold, with many dark tones and shades. Only a few things in the movie have warmer colors, like the heroine and her companion. The movie feels very desolate and lonely—the streets of the city are empty and abandoned. When we do see other people, they resemble stone statues, more automata than human. 7/10.
