It is part of the *A Very Short Introduction* series, which tries to condense important philosophers into an easily understandable format. This book is not only about Heidegger’s major work, *Being and Time*, but also covers his other, less notable works, including his lectures.
It is certainly interesting to listen to, and I think the core concepts are well conveyed. But, as with all Heidegger-related material, I can’t help but feel that everything remains a bit foggy and not as clear as the work of philosophers from more analytical traditions.
