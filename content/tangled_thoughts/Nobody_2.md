I love that the second Nobody begins exactly like the first one. The fighting scenes and the music are just as delicious as in the last. Who thinks of using a waterslide in the middle of a gunfight, or hiding landmines in a ball pool? But I digress, the start is slower than the first. The original felt more compressed, more condensed, and took itself less seriously. Overall, I would say the second is a bit worse than the first. 6/10.
