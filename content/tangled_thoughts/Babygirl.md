My two friends and I decided to attend a movie sneak preview, where a theater shows a random film that is currently airing, so you have no idea what the movie is until it starts.  

Now, onto the movie. An older woman in a position of power can't orgasm with her husband and has some masochistic tendencies. She decides to begin an affair with a young intern at her firm, in which the intern sexually dominates her.  

First off, the plot feels like it came straight from 4chan with how cliché it is—a female writer creating a story about an older, empowered woman with rape fantasies... okay.  
But beyond that, I found the movie’s moral message grotesque: cheat on your husband, abuse your position of power with the person you're cheating with, and manipulate coworkers you feel threatened by. And in the end? Zero accountability, no consequences, no penance. The movie ends with her still being the CEO of her company, her husband staying with her and even forgiving her completely (they seem happier than ever), and, somehow, he can finally gratify her. So she gets rewarded for cheating? To top it off, the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree—her daughter is the same way, cheating on her partner with, once again, no consequences.  

The second thing that really annoyed me was the film’s obsessive focus on pleasure, especially highlighted in the final scene where the husband finger-bangs his wife, who finally orgasms. Focusing on pleasure itself is fine, but if that's the case, either make the moral message something meaningful (like cheating is bad and has consequences) or drop the moral preaching entirely and just make it an erotica.  

The movie itself: 4/10.  
The sneak preview experience—watching other people squirm awkwardly during the BDSM scenes: 6/10.
