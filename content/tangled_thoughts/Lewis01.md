> Christ says "Give me All. I don't want so much of
> your time and so much of your money and so much of your work: I want You. I have not come to
> torment your natural self, but to kill it. No half-measures are any good. I don't want to cut off a branch
> here and a branch there, I want to have the whole tree down. I don't want to drill the tooth, or crown it,
> or stop it, but to have it out. Hand over the whole natural self, all the desires which you think innocent
> as well as the ones you think wickedâ€”the whole outfit. I will give you a new self instead. In fact, I
> will give you Myself: my own will shall become yours."
