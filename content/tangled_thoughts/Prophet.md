I like it. Just the French-Algerian setting already makes the movie interesting. Add to that the grim prison atmosphere and, at times, uniquely stylized imageryâ€”it really nails the mood.  

Leave day in prison is wild: they send you out for a day, you do whatever, and then at the end of the day, you just go back to prison.  

The actors are great too. The whole thing has a special vibe, that gets really enhanced by the fantastical elements. 7.5/10.
