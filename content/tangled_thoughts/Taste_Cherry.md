This is an Iranian movie, and the landscape and scenery are stunning—dusty, sandy hills decorated with colorful trees. In the movie, a character tells a joke that was my dad’s favorite, one he used to tell me often when I was little:

> A Turk goes to see a doctor. He says, 'When I touch my body with my finger, it hurts. When I touch my head, it hurts. My leg—it hurts. My belly, my hand—it all hurts.' The doctor examines him and says, 'Your body is fine, but your finger is broken.'

The movie: 7/10.
