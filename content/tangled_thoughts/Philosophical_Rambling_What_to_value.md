It follows a simple argument about what I think is a good idea to value (I'm deliberately avoiding the words [*should* or *ought*](/articles/the_meaning_of_ought/)):

1. From Heidegger, we learn that [all purpose and meaning depend on *Dasein*](/articles/where_the_eiffel_tower_is_is_not_obejctive/): that is, our lived experience as human beings in the world.
2. From Sartre and Heidegger, we learn that *Dasein* expresses itself through [authenticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticity_%28_philosophy%29): the degree to which a person's actions align with their values and desires, despite external pressures.
3. I also believe in [long-range voluntary control](/tangled_thoughts/philosophical_ramblings_what_is_belief/): the idea that we can shape our beliefs by deliberately exposing ourselves to certain ideas or values over a long period of time.
4. From the Stoic [principle of control](/tangled_thoughts/epictetus8/), we learn that the only thing truly in our control is how we respond to situations, that is our character or virtue. Everything else, health, wealth, reputation, is subject to luck and external forces.
5. From these points, the following conclusions emerge:
   * From (1), value is not objective but grounded in lived, subjective experience.
   * From (2), our values are made real through authenticity, by living in alignment with them.
   * From (3), some values can be intentionally chosen through long-term engagement.
   * From (4), virtue is the only value that lies fully within our control.
6. Therefore, if I want to live the best possible life, not one based on chance or unstable externals, I should value something I can reliably attain. Since virtue is the only thing entirely in my control (per (4)), it becomes the most stable foundation for living well. By choosing (per (1) and (3)) to value virtue, I maximize my chances of fulfillment and stability. This is expressed through authenticity: by living and embodying this value openly and without hiding (per (2)).
