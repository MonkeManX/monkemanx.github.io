This is a black-and-white movie. It's an interesting character introspection. Our protagonist is whisked away from his happy family home to New York, where he lives under the guardianship of a bank. From that point on, he never experiences love again. The only affection he receives from his guardian is material—based on money. 
As a result, he lives a wealthy but deeply unhappy life, unable to buy back the peace of mind he once had as a child in his family home. He pushes away all his friends and his wife, trying to fill the emptiness with material possessions—statues and paintings he collects from around the world.

> Kane: You know, Mr. Thatcher, if I hadn't been very rich, I might have been a really great man.    
> Thatcher: Don't you think you are?    
> Kane: I think I did pretty well under the circumstances.  
> Thatcher: What would you like to have been?   
> Kane: Everything you hate.   

For a film considered one of the greatest of all time, I expected more. That said, for its era, it was probably very innovative. 7/10.
