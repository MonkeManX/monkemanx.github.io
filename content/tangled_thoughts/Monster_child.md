Highly recommend it. Thematically, it deals with the question: what makes a monster a monster? Is it that it looks different, or the choices it makes? 8/10.

Also, whatever they have, I want it. Two organisms becoming one, a merging of two subjectivities into a single consciousness, total understanding.
But in the end, it’s just a story, a fairy tale. There’s no such thing as living forever in your dream world in bliss and happiness; desire will arise again and take it away from you.
Happiness does not exist independent of one’s mind.
