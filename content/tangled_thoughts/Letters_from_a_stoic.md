*Letters from a Stoic* was written around 60 AD by Lucius Seneca, an advisor to Emperor Nero. The book contains 124 letters written by Seneca to a friend. They read more like a diary and advice given to a friend rather than a hardcore philosophical discourse. That is not to say it lacks philosophy, but compared to Epictetus' *Discourses*, it is more muted.  
For those interested in Stoicism, *Discourses* by Epictetus is far better. Seneca's book is more like an ancient diary with a Stoic lens applied to it.
