This is a Wes Anderson anthology, meaning it’s a collection of multiple short stories. I liked the first one the most; the others were rather gruesome. And, as always with any Anderson movie, the set design and colors were gorgeous. 7/10.

>  Men like Henry Sugar are to be found drifting like seaweed all over the world. They can be seen especially in London, New York, Paris, Nassau, Montego Bay, Cannes, and San Tropez. They are not particularly bad men, but they are not good men either. They are of no particular importance; they're simply part of the decoration.
