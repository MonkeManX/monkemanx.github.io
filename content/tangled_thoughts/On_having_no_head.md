I’ve read this book twice. Sometimes I think I almost get what he’s aiming at, and then it completely slips my mind again. At times the book sounds like it’s arguing for phenomenalism, but that can’t be right. Strange book. I might need to reread it later in life, maybe with some interpretation. I don’t know.
