> By the Platonic books I was admonished to return into myself.18 With
> you as my guide I entered into my innermost citadel, and was given power to do
> so because you had become my helper (Ps. 29: 11). I entered and with my soul’s
> eye, such as it was, saw above that same eye of my soul the immutable light
> higher than my mind—not the light of every day, obvious to anyone, nor a larger
> version of the same kind which would, as it were, have given out a much
> brighter light and filled everything with its magnitude.19 It was not that light, but
> a different thing, utterly different from all our kinds of light. It transcended my
> mind, not in the way that oil floats on water, nor as heaven is above earth. It was
> superior because it made me, and I was inferior because I was made by it. The
> person who knows the truth knows it, and he who knows it knows eternity. Love
> knows it.20 Eternal truth and true love and beloved eternity: you are my God. To
> you I sigh ‘day and night’ (Ps. 42: 2). When I first came to know you, you raised
> me up to make me see that what I saw is Being, and that I who saw am not yet
> Being. And you gave a shock to the weakness of my sight by the strong radiance
> of your rays, and I trembled with love and awe.21’ And I found myself far from
> you ‘in the region of dissimilarity’, 22 and heard as it were your voice from on
> high: ‘I am the food of the fully grown; grow and you will feed on me. And you
> will not change me into you like the food your flesh eats, but you will be
> changed into me.’ [...]
>  I heard in the
> way one hears within the heart, and all doubt left me.23’ I would have found it
> easier to doubt whether I was myself alive than that there is no truth ‘understood
> from the things that are made’ (Rom. 1: 20).
