> Man's ultimate concern must be expressed symbolically, because symbolic language alone is able to express the ultimate [...]
>
> Symbols have one characteristic in common with signs:
> they point beyond themselves to something else.
>
> Decisive is the fact that **signs do not participate in the reality of that to which they point**, while symbols do.
> Therefore, signs can be replaced for reasons of expediency or convention, while symbols cannot.
>
> This leads to the **second characteristic** of the symbol: It participates
> in that to which it points; the flag participates in the power
> and dignity of the nation for which it stands.
>
> The **third characteristic** of a symbol is that it opens up new levels of reality which are otherwise closed to us.
> A picture and a poem reveal elements of reality which cannot be approached scientifically.
>
> Symbols cannot be reproduced intentionally — this is the **fifth characteristic**.
> They grow out of the individual or collective unconscious and cannot function without being accepted by the unconscious dimension of our being.
>
> The **sixth and last characteristic** of the symbol is a consequence of the fact that symbols cannot be invented.
> Like living beings, they grow and they die.
> They grow when the situation is ripe for them, and they die when the situation changes. [...]

> Is it not only in those cases in which the content of the ultimate concern is called "God" that we are in the realm of symbols?
> The answer is that everything which is a matter of unconditional concern is made into a god.
>
> If the nation is someone's ultimate concern, the name of the nation becomes a sacred name and the nation receives divine qualities which far surpass the reality of the being and functioning of the nation.
>
> The reason for this transformation of concepts into symbols is the character of ultimacy and the nature of faith.
> That which is the true ultimate transcends the realm of finite reality infinitely.
> Therefore, no finite reality expresses it directly and properly.
> Religiously speaking, "God transcends his own name."
>
> Whatever we say about that which concerns us ultimately, whether or not we call it God, has a symbolic meaning.
> It points beyond itself while participating in that to which it points.
> In no other way can faith express itself adequately.
> The language of faith is the language of symbols. [...]
>
> Where there is ultimate concern, God can be identified in the name of God.
> One god can deny the other one.
> Ultimate concern cannot deny its own character as ultimate.
> Therefore, it affirms what is meant by the word "God."
