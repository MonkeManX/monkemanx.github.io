This is the connection between mysticism and ethics I was looking for: the recognition of the subjectâ€“object divide, and then the melting of the two, resulting in an outlook that, when kept in mind at all times, makes negative virtue impossible. For how can you sin when you know that you would be transgressing against the holy that you have experienced yourself?
