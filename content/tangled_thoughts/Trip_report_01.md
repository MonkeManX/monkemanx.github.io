>  I am and, for as long as I can remember, I have always been a poor visualizer.
> Words, even the pregnant words of poets, do not evoke pictures in my mind.
> When I recall something, the memory does not present itself to me as a vividly seen event or
> object. [...]
> This was the world—a poor thing but my own—which I expected to see transformed into
something completely unlike itself.
>
> The change which actually took place in that world was in no sense revolutionary. [...] But at no time were there faces or forms of men or animals. I saw no landscapes, no enormous spaces, no magical growth and metamorphosis of buildings, nothing remotely like a drama or a parable.
