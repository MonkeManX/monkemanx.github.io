I am tired and my throat hurts.
Maybe I am getting sick? That would suck, just when I was finally free from uni. On the other side maybe I am just tired.
This desire of going to bed and never waking up again, resting in my comfy warm bed, dreaming about what? I don't even know. But I bet it would be a nice dream. Maybe about being a bird flying all around the world. That sounds nice.
