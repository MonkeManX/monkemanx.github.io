I like it. It's by the author who wrote *Brave New World*, and it's about his experience with the psychedelic drug mescaline and his attempt to make sense of that experience. Though I will say, to fully appreciate it, there are quite a few prerequisites one should be familiar with, such as having done psychedelics, Kant’s ontology (*das Ding an sich*), Meister Eckhart, Buddhism (e.g. “suchness”), and, especially for the second half (*Heaven and Hell*), art, paintings, and literature.
