> Late have I loved you, beauty so old and so new: late have I loved
> you. And see, you were within and I was in the external world and sought you
> there, and in my unlovely state I plunged into those lovely created things which
> you made. You were with me, and I was not with you. The lovely things kept me
> far from you, though if they did not have their existence in you, they had no
> existence at all. You called and cried out loud and shattered my deafness. You
> were radiant and resplendent, you put to flight my blindness. You were fragrant,
> and I drew in my breath and now pant after you. I tasted you, and I feel but
> hunger and thirst for you. You touched me, and I am set on fire to attain the
> peace which is yours.

> ~ Confession, X (38)
