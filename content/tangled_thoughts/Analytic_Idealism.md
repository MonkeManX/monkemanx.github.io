**[Physicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism)** is the prominent metaphysics of modern times, so much so that if one deviates from it, one is not only looked at with suspicion but also labeled irrational.
For what else should everything be made of, in its most inner nature, if not atoms described by physical quantities, organized in the correct way? At least, that is what science seems to tell us.

This book not only tries to show that physicalism does not have as much explanatory power as people hope, but also that it relies on false assumptions. The author, Bernardo Kastrup, proposes an alternative worldview: that what things are made of at their core is nothing other than experience/subjectivity/mentality, and that what appears to us as the physical world is merely a representation of these underlying mental processes. He calls this metaphysics **analytical idealism**.

Personally, I find his view very attractive, particularly because papers like *What Is It Like to Be a Bat?* have already pushed me in the direction of rejecting physicalism. But I do need to read more about idealism to be certain.
