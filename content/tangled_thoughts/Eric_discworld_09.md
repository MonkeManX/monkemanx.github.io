Part of the *Discworld* series, but it's pretty standalone and can be read without knowing the other books. It's one of the shortest works in the *Discworld* series. At first, I was a bit worried because I’d heard this was the worst book in the series—too weird and out there—but I actually found it hilarious. Maybe that says more about me than about the book.

It’s a whimsical story, very much focused on comedy, satirizing everything from classic wizard tropes to the concept of Christian hell.

Random side thought: why did the demon from the myth of Sisyphus sound like the fat girl from *Derry Girls* in the audiobook version? Maybe it's because, both are irish.

Also, how the fuck does hell work? If you get promoted for being incompetent or doing something otherwise bad, does that mean all the top guys in hell are literally useless?

One of the funniest parts was this:

> Interestingly enough, the gods of the Disc have never bothered much about judging the souls of the
> dead, and so people only go to hell if that’s where they believe, in their deepest
> heart, that they deserve to go.
> Which they won't do if they don’t know about it.
>
> This explains why it is important to shoot missionaries on sight.

Also great:

> It is hard to say whether the Luggage was happy or not. It had
> viciously attacked fourteen demons so far, and had three of them
> cornered in their own pit of boiling oil. Soon it would have to follow its master, but it didn’t have to rush.
