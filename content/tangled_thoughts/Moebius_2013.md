South Korean smut horror drama? This is the weirdest movie I've ever seen. A mother discovers her husband cheating and unsuccessfully tries to cut off his dick. After that, she ends up cutting off her son's penis. The father then gives his son an implant, but the son can't get an erection anymore. So, the father teaches him how to achieve orgasm by rubbing a stone very hard against his skin. And from there, the story continues.

Most striking about this film, besides the bonkers plot, is that there isn't a single line of dialogue. The entire plot is conveyed through expression and other non-verbal gestures. 6/10.
