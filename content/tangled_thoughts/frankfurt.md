Yesterday I was visiting a friend in [Frankfurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt), I made some photos of it which you can see below. To be honest, I have seen more beautiful cities like Vienna or Munich. Though the river that runs through the city and the skyscraper made it look rather unique for Germany.
