> By your mercy our worldly activities always

> ‘How long is this to go on?’ We frequently used to speak in this way. But
> although that is what we said, we did not give up those activities. There was no
> certain source of light which we could grasp after we had abandoned them.

> myself was exceedingly astonished as I anxiously reflected how long a
> time had elapsed since the nineteenth year of my life, when I began to burn with
> a zeal for wisdom, planning that when I had found it I would abandon all the
> empty hopes and lying follies of hollow ambitions. And here I was already thirty,
> and still mucking about in the same mire in a state of indecision, avid to enjoy
> present fugitive delights which were dispersing my concentration, while I was
> saying: ‘Tomorrow I shall find it; see, it will become perfectly clear, and I shall have no more doubts. [...] What great men
> the Academic philosophers were! Nothing for the conduct of life can be a matter

> When can it be sought? Ambrose has no time. There is no time for reading.
> Where should we look for the books we need? Where and when can we obtain

> Church’s educated men think it wrong to believe that God is bounded by the
> shape of a human body. Why do we hesitate to knock at the door which opens
> the way to all the rest? Our pupils occupy our mornings; what should we do with
> the remaining hours? Why do we not investigate our problem? But then when
> should we go to pay respects to our more influential friends, whose patronage we
> need?14 When are we to prepare what our students are paying for? When are we
> to refresh ourselves by allowing the mind to relax from the tension of anxieties?
>
> Let all that perish! Let us set aside these vain and empty ambitions. Let
> us concentrate ourselves exclusively on the investigation of the truth. Life is a
> misery, death is uncertain. It may suddenly carry us off. In what state shall we
> depart this life? Where are we to learn the things we have neglected here? And
> must we not rather pay for this negligence with punishments? What if death
> itself will cut off and end all anxiety by annihilating the mind? This too, then, is
> a question needing scrutiny.
