Cool intro song. Also this is maybe the first nicolas cage movie that I do not actively disliked. Besides that decent story, good characters and has some nice shots. Thematically, we have the road to hell. **7/10**

> There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation. That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet. The only question is: How do we arm the other 11?
