For the past two weeks, I’ve been meditating regularly (following Culadasa) after getting up in the morning. Today was different. I was exhausted from the previous workday and decided to stay at home, which threw me off my rhythm, as such I skipped my regular mediation session in the morning.

After lunch, I chose to meditate a bit longer than usual to “make amends.” That’s when something happened—something I can only describe as similar to what Plotinus called [*Henosis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henosis): the union with *the One* (i.e., God) through meditation and contemplation, as described in his writings. Or *ecstasy*, from the Greek meaning “standing out of oneself.”

It began with me smiling. The smile grew wider and wider, followed by a feeling of overwhelming bliss. Everything outside my mind ceased to exist. Before my eyes, I saw myself moving through a tunnel. It lasted a few minutes but felt like only a few seconds.

When I opened my eyes, my surroundings felt strange and alien—accompanied by a deep sense that the things in front of me weren’t real.

**Note:** This is strictly a *report of personal experience* (*Erfahrungsbericht*). I make no claims whatsoever about metaphysical reality or the existence of God. It’s also worth noting that I’m currently reading parts of the *Enneads* by Plotinus, and my experience may have been influenced by this.
