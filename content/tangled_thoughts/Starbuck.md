I love Starbuckâ€”her cheeky grin, her nonchalant way of speaking, a bit arrogant but still aware of her limitations, the way she commands her soldiers, and even how she walks around with her crutch.  
She's especially cute while torturing Cylons, shining so bright; I only wish the scene had been longer, so that I could have heard more sweet Cylons screams.
