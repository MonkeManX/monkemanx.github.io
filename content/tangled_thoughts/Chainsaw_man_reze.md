Absolutely gorgeous movie. So pretty, every frame a painting. Very impressive action scenes too. I was also slightly disappointed that we saw so little of Power.

There is one critique I have: I think the arc works really well in the anime, where you’re already familiar with the characters. Because the beginning of the movie is rather slice-of-life, the hook is missing. This works better in the anime, where you already know the characters and just like seeing them interact. However, I think it would have been better if there had been a stronger hook at the beginning. Though I have to admit, I’m not sure how that could have been done without giving away what is later revealed.

I loved the post-credit scene. Power forever. **8/10**
