Another book from the Discworld franchise. This one is different from the others in that it has alternating chapters, one chapter being a regular fantasy story about wizards in the Discworld, and the next explaining various sciences, from biology and evolution to particle physics and space. It covers a lot.

It’s well done: the science is understandable, and the connection between the two threads is handled nicely. I particularly liked the part about how we humans struggle with the idea of becoming, it echoes process theology.
