> As in silence I vigorously pursued my quest, inarticulate sufferings of my
> heart were loudly pleading for your mercy. You knew what I endured; no human
> being knew. How little of it my tongue could put into words for the ears of my
> closest friends! Neither the time nor my powers of speech were sufficient to tell
> them of the full tumult of my soul. But all of it came to your hearing, how ‘I
> roared from the groaning of my heart, and my desire was before you, and the
> light of my eyes was not with me’ (Ps. 37: 9–11). That was inward, while I was
> still in externals.12 It was not in a place; but I was fixing my attention on things
> contained in space, and there I found no place to rest in, nor did those external
> things receive me so that I could say ‘It is enough and it is well’. Nor did they
> allow me to return where it was enough and well for me. I was superior to these
> external objects but inferior to you, and you are my true joy if I submit to you,
> and you have made subject to me what you created to be lower than me.
