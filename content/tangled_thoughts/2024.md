With the year 2024 coming to an end, and inspired by [sizeofcat's end-of-the-year summary](https://sizeof.cat/post/2024-in-review/), I thought I would reflect on the past year and highlight some things I accomplished.

## Media  

I included only media that I haven't mentioned elsewhere already.  

- I read **7** proper books; the best one was *The Puffin Book of Nonsense Verse*.  
- I read **numerous** webnovels (I really need to find a way to track them). The best one was *The Wandering Inn*.  
- Movie of the year: *The Thing*.  
- Song of the year: *I'm So Tired* by Fugazi.  
- Album of the year: *Pinkerton*.  

## Website  

- I joined **1** webring.  
- I wrote **30** articles.  
- I wrote **38** paper summaries.  
- I wrote approximately **117,400** words in total.  
- The total storage needed for the website has increased to **1.62 GB**.
