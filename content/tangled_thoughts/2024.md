With the year 2024 coming to an end, and inspired by [sizeofcat's end-of-the-year summary](https://sizeof.cat/post/2024-in-review/), I thought I would reflect on the past year and highlight some things I accomplished.

## Media

I included only media that I haven't mentioned elsewhere already.

- I read **7** proper books; the best one was *The Puffin Book of Nonsense Verse*.
- I read **numerous** webnovels (I really need to find a way to track them). The best one was *The Wandering Inn*.
- Movie of the year: *The Thing*.
- Song of the year: *I'm So Tired* by Fugazi.
- Album of the year: *Pinkerton*.
