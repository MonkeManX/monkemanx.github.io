Paul Tillich’s notion of faith, as described in The Dynamics of Faith, is used, which I approve

> In the course of a long
> life in the service of our Mother
> th e Church, let me tell you that
> there is one sin I have come to
> fear above all others. Certainty.
> Certainty is the great enemy of
> unity. Certainty is the deadly
> enemy of tolerance. Even Christ was
> not certain at the end.

> “My God, my God, why have you
> forsaken me?” He cried out in His
> agony at the ninth hour on the
> cross. Our faith is a living thing
> precisely because it walks hand in
> hand with doubt. If there was only
> certainty, and if there was no
> doubt, there would be no mystery,
> and therefore no need for faith.
> Let us pray that God will grant us
> a Pope who doubts. Let Him grant us
> a Pope who sins and asks for
> forgiveness. And carries on
