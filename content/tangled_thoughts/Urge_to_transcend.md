> The urge to transcend self-conscious selfhood is, as I have said, a principal
> appetite of the soul. When, for whatever reason, men and women fail to

> exercises, they are apt to resort to religion's chemical surrogates-alcohol and
> "goof pills" in the modern West, alcohol and opium in the East, hashish in the
> Mohammedan world, alcohol and marijuana in Central America, alcohol and
> coca in the Andes, alcohol and the barbiturates in the more up-to-date regions
> of South America. [...] The employment for religious purposes
> of toxic substances is "extraordinarily widespread.... The practices studied in

> less than among those who have reached a high pitch of civilization. We are
> therefore dealing not with exceptional facts, which might justifiably be
