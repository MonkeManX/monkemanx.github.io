Swedish is such a meme language. I wonder what the point of the movie was. Don't sleep with your teacher? Don't spend all your money on alcohol and speculative investments in the price of wool clothing? Maybe that war is horrible? Or is it not to lie to your mother? The throughline could have definitely been stronger. However, because it was filmed in Sweden and set in 1943, it has an unorthodox vibe to it, which I like. 6/10.
