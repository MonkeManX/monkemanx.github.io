Around 50 AD, the major philosophical schools were the following:  

- **Stoic**: They claimed that the only true good is virtue, while everything else is indifferent. However, some things are preferable to others—for example, good health is not inherently good but is preferable to sickness.  
  - **Followers**: Zeno, Chrysippus, Epictetus, Seneca, Marcus Aurelius  
- **Cynic**: This school can be seen as a more extreme version of Stoicism. Virtue is still considered the only good, but Cynics also reject all wealth, power, glory, and worldly possessions.  
  - **Followers**: Diogenes  
- **Epicurean**: They were hedonists, valuing pleasure as the highest good. However, they claimed that the highest pleasure is achieved through a simple life and abstinence.  
  - **Followers**: Epicurus  
- **Peripatetic**: This school can be interpreted as a weaker form of Stoicism. Virtue is still considered the highest good, but things like wealth and good health are also regarded as good.  
  - **Followers**: Aristotle  
- **Academic Skepticism**: They believed that knowledge of any kind is impossible—for example, we cannot be certain that external objects exist.  
  - **Followers**: Arcesilaus, Carneades, Cicero  
- **Skepticism/Pyrrhonism**: They rejected all dogma, claiming that we should suspend all judgment because we can never be certain of knowing anything. Importantly, they did not claim that knowledge is impossible—only that we cannot be sure.  
  - **Followers**: Pyrrho, Aenesidemus
