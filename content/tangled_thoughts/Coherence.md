**Stream of consciousness, ending spoiler:**
What a garbage movie. Amateurish acting, shit cinematography, no cool visuals. Shot like a cheap horror movie: oh look, even the classic eerie music is there, hooray. Also, we’re in a horror movie, so let’s all separate and go our separate ways; this won’t go wrong, surely.

The whole movie being set in an American diner is cliché, and so are all the characters. It uses pseudo-science for a mystery plot. I don’t care about the mystery and don’t get why anybody would care about that. What do people in other realities have to do with me? Everyone acts hysterical, and the movie insists upon itself. It takes itself so seriously for all the bullshit it peddles. Multiple times my eyes physically rolled in their sockets.

Finally, the ending was shit. Actions should have consequences. She killed a person and then woke up like it never happened, nice deus ex machina. She should have had to live with the consequences and be confronted with them. Then the movie would have at least had a learnable lesson to teach. As it is, it’s just a movie with a shitty mystery plot.

I guess the movie *might* be good if you like mystery plots, but don’t expect more than that.

When the line came:

> *“If there are a million different realities, don’t you realize what this means? I have slept with your wife in every one of them.”*

I finally understood what this movie was about: the entire movie was ragebait. One big joke. I wasted my time on this, thank you. **4/10**
