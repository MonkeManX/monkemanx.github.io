### Fun Fact 1

The mathematical technique called [proof by induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction), despite its name containing *induction*, is in fact **deductive**â€”shocker!


### Fun Fact 2

In the philosophy of language, there's a theory called *referential semantics*, which says that the meaning of an expression is the object (or objects) the expression refers to. But this leads to a problem: either a sentence refers to an object, or it does not. Consider the sentence:

(A) "The current King of France is bald."

or its negation:

(not A) "The current King of France is not bald."

We realize that neither (A) nor (not A) is true, because France currently has no king. On this dilemma, [Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell) famously remarked:

> Hegelians, who love a synthesis, will probably conclude that he wears a wig.
