One thing to note is that among the major Christian denominations (Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant), this might only be possible in Protestant theology because of the [Five Solas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_solae), which emphasize "by faith alone" and "by grace alone" (meaning salvation is not dependent on personal merit but solely on your faith and the grace of god). However, there is debate over what is included or necessary in "faith" and "grace."

Interesting articles on this topic include the [Sinner's Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinner%27s_prayer) and the [Lordship Salvation Controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lordship_salvation_controversy).
