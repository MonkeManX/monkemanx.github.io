After Camu the most important question is that of suicide or in other words the only serious philosophical question is "Should I kill myself?"

I ocasionally wonder how it would be to die, what if a brick would fall down a house smashing my head? What if I would stumble and fall on the train tracks? What If I was old lying in my bed like grandpa slowly dying? What If...

Naturally, I would never do suicide, but not because I have a tight relationship with life (that is not to say that my life is bad in any way or form) but more the opposite, my most central fear is death. Or not fear itseld but the thought of not existing.

Recently, I read Plato's "The Apology" and "Phaedo", in which Socrates get sentenced to death, and his friends asks him, why he doesn't just ecape (which he could have easily done)?
On which Socrates answers: "For the state of death is one of two things: either it is virtually nothingness, so that the dead has no consciousness of anything, or it is, as people say, a change and migration of the soul from this to another place. And if it is unconsciousness, [40d] like a sleep in which the sleeper does not even dream, death would be a wonderful gain. For I think if any one were to pick out that night in which he slept a dreamless sleep and, comparing with it the other nights and days of his life, were to say, after due consideration, how many days and nights in his life had passed more pleasantly than that night,â€”I believe that not only any private person, but even the great King of Persia himself [40e] would find that they were few in comparison with the other days and nights. So if such is the nature of death, I count it a gain; for in that case, all time seems to be no longer than one night. But on the other hand, if death is, as it were, a change of habitation from here to some other place, and if what we are told is true, that all the dead are there, what greater blessing could there be, judges?"

I like that sentiment.
