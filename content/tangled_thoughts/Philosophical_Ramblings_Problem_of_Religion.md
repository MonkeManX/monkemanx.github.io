The fundamental problem of religion is that all religions presuppose certain metaphysical claims that we have no way of verifying. If that's the case, then how do we evaluate their truth?

One way to approach this is by adopting a universalist position—suggesting that all religions contain some form of truth and are, in some way, all valid. However, the problem with this view is that religions often contradict one another, sometimes making completely opposing claims. How do we reconcile these contradictions?

For example, Protestant Christianity advocates for salvation through faith alone, which stands in stark contrast to Buddhist traditions, where personal experience and direct validation are central. Another example is that the Christian end goal is to live in heaven with God and praise Him, while the Buddhist goal is the cessation of desire—a state that seems incompatible with the Christian goal, which explicitly involves wanting (e.g., desiring God or heaven).

But Buddhism itself encounters a paradox: desiring the cessation of desire is itself a form of desire. So a Buddhist should stop wanting the cessation of desire—but if they do that, they have nothing left to strive for or advocate.

I want to offer two ways to address this issue:

**First**, we can ask: *What does "living in heaven with God" actually mean?* Following thinkers like Meister Eckhart or Paul Tillich, if we understand God not as a being among other beings but as the "ground of being"—that which makes existence possible—then "heaven" should not be imagined as a literal place where hymns are sung forever. Instead, it could be understood as the fulfillment of our deepest potential, a kind of merging with the *Abgrund* (ground or abyss), not becoming Being itself but becoming our truest selves.

This notion is very similar to the Buddhist concept of *nirvana*: the cessation of suffering through the cessation of desire, resulting in a mode of pure being. Both could be interpreted as forms of "becoming" or "self-realization" (a better term may be needed here). In this way, the two traditions become compatible on a deeper metaphysical level.

However, the problem with this approach is that it flattens the uniqueness of each religion. They become too similar, losing their distinctiveness in terms of ritual, language, and tradition.

**Second**, we might investigate the nature of God from a different angle. Suppose God transcends not only the physical world but even logic itself. That would mean God comes before anything, including the categories of contradiction and coherence. If God transcends logic, then contradictory things could be true about Him at the same time. Thus, the apparent contradictions between religions would cease to be problematic—they could all be true in different ways.

But this solution, too, is problematic. If *anything goes*, then concepts like nirvana, God, or heaven lose their specific meaning. If they can mean anything, then they mean nothing.

We can also consider the problem through a **phenomenological lens**, following thinkers like Husserl, but applied to religion. Phenomenology studies how things appear subjectively to us. Through this lens, even if all religions point toward some shared transcendent reality, their rituals and practices differ because of cultural and subjective differences. Religion becomes the culturally inflected response to a shared, though ineffable, transcendent reality.
