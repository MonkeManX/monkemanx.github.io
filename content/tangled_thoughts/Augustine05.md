> The burden of the world weighed me down with a sweet drowsiness
> such as commonly occurs during sleep. The thoughts with which I meditated
> about you were like the efforts of those who would like to get up but are
> overcome by deep sleep and sink back again. No one wants to be asleep all the
> time, and the sane judgement of everyone judges it better to be awake. Yet often
> a man defers shaking off sleep when his limbs are heavy with slumber. Although
> displeased with himself he is glad to take a bit longer, even when the time to get
> up has arrived. In this kind of way I was sure it was better for me to render
> myself up to your love than to surrender to my own cupidity. But while the
> former course was pleasant to think about and had my notional assent, the latter
> was more pleasant and overcame me. I had no answer to make to you when you
> said to me ‘Arise, you who are asleep, rise from the dead, and Christ shall give
> you light’ (Eph. 5: 14). Though at every point you showed that what you were
> saying was true, yet I, convinced by that truth, had no answer to give you except
> merely slow and sleepy words: ‘At once’—‘But presendy’—‘Just a little longer,
> please’. But ‘At once, at once’ never came to the point of decision, and ‘Just a
> little longer, please’ went on and on for a long while. In vain I ‘delighted in your
> law in respect of the inward man; but another law in my members fought against
> the law of my mind and led me captive in the law of sin which was in my
> members’ (Rom. 7: 22). The law of sin is the violence of habit by which even the
> unwilling mind is dragged down and held, as it deserves to be, since by its own
> choice it slipped into the habit. ‘Wretched man that I was, who would deliver me
> from this body of death other than your grace through Jesus Christ our Lord?’
> (Rom. 7: 24–5).
