Deadpool vs. Wolverine(2024): Don't expect much from the story, plot, or character arcsâ€”they're all just a vehicle to deliver the funnsies and slaughter, though the comedy sometimes degenerates into cringe, I especially loved when Deadpool said, "I am Marvel Jesus," and then proceeded to Deadpool all over the place. 7/10.
