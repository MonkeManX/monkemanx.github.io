> "Do thou, then, my son, know that All Things are destined to be commingled in the Father; nothing perishes and nothing is destroyed, nothing is annihilated; All returns, All is sanctified, All is made one, All is commingled, and the Word is fulfilled which was said, 'God shall be all and in all'. Hells shall pass, and torments shall, be done away; prisoners shall be released; for even reprobates are absolved, and outcasts return, and those that are far off are brought near; and chastisement ceases, my son, and the Scourger scourges not, and the Judge shall judge no more, and the Officer shall not condemn, and the last farthing is given, and the prisoner who was bound is loosed [but he who has repented before the imprisonment has given the last farthing]; for Demons receive grace, and men receive mercy; and Angels minister not, and Seraphs consecrate no more, and Thrones keep not their primacy; for the Orders that are above pass away, and the Distinctions that are below are abolished, and Everything becomes One Thing; for even God shall pass, and Christ shall be done away, and the Spirit shall no more be called the Spirit - for names pass away and not Essence; for if distinction pass, who will call whom? and who, on the other hand, will answer whom? for One neither names nor is named. This is the limit of All and the end of Everything; and do thou take heed."

I do like the Neoplatonic notion of divinity more than the conservative Christian one.
