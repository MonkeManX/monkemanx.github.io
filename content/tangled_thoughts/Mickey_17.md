The music was fun, and I did chuckle occasionally. I like that it doesn’t take itself too seriously. You can also clearly see the influence of Trump on the villain, but it didn’t feel forced. The movie has many cool ideas that I haven’t seen used much in other films. 7/10.

Also cloning is a more convincing thought experiment then doubling like described in [Derek Parfit Paper](/paper-summary/unimportance_of_identity/), though they did not do much with it.
