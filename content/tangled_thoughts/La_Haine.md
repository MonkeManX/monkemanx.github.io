Black and white French movie. It has a real vibe to it, with some really cool shots and a streak of surrealism. I think the main theme is: "You're in a really shitty situation right now, but you have the power to change it. In fact, if you don’t stop messing around, it’s going to end badly."

It’s about having chances over and over again, but instead of taking them, one falls back into old, self-destructive patterns. 7/10.

[One interpretation](https://petervimeoafc.medium.com/la-haine-its-how-you-land-a70543216335) I liked.
