> See how full of old errors are those who say to us: ‘What was God doing
> before he made heaven and earth? If he was unoccupied’, they say, ‘and doing
> nothing, why does he not always remain the same for ever, just as before
> creation he abstained from work? [...]
>
> This is my reply to anyone who asks: ‘What was God doing before he
> made heaven and earth?’ [...]
> I say that you, our God, are the Creator of every created being, and
> assuming that by ‘heaven and earth’ is meant every created thing I boldly
> declare: Before God made heaven and earth, he was not making anything. [...]
>
> If, however, someone’s mind is flitting and wandering over images of
> past times, and is astonished that you, all powerful, all creating, and all
> sustaining God, artificer of heaven and earth, abstained for unnumbered ages
> from this work before you actually made it, he should wake up and take note that
> his surprise rests on a mistake. [...]
>
> You have made time itself. Time could not elapse before you made time. [...]
>
> It is not in time that you precede times. Otherwise you would not
> precede all times. In the sublimity of an eternity which is always in the present,
> you are before all things past and transcend all things future, because they are
> still to come, and when they have come they are past. ‘But you are the same and
> your years do not fail’ (Ps. 101: 28). Your ‘years’ neither go nor come. Ours
> come and go so that all may come in succession. All your ‘years’ subsist in
> simultaneity, because they do not change; those going away are not thrust out by
> those coming in. But the years which are ours will not all be until all years have
> ceased to be. Your ‘years’ are ‘one day’ (Ps. 89: 4; 2 Pet. 3: 8), and your ‘day’ is
> not any and every day but Today, because your Today does not yield to a
> tomorrow, nor did it follow on a yesterday. Your Today is eternity. So you begat
> one coeternal with you, to whom you said: ‘Today I have begotten you’ (Ps. 2: 7;
> Heb. 5: 5). You created all times and you exist before all times. Nor was there
> any time when time did not exist.
>
> There was therefore no time when you had not made something,
> because you made time itself. No times are coeternal with you since you are
> permanent. If they were permanent, they would not be times.
