I finally passed my Optimization Theory exam! This time it was a 30-minute oral re-exam. Since I had already failed the exam twice before, it was basically my last chance — otherwise, I would’ve been kicked out of uni. Thankfully, the professor was really nice and created a relaxed atmosphere. At the end of the exam, he said, “Why didn’t you do it like this last time? Then we could’ve saved ourselves the whole thing.”

Optimization Theory isn’t even that hard of a module compared to other math ones. For my master’s, I’ve made up my mind not to choose math as a minor again. Instead, I’m planning to switch to philosophy — it seems to suit me better.
