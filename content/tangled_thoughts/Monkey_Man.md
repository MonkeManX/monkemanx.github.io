I had to watch this movie because of the name. The cinematography is notable, it has some really nice scenes, though it’s quite strange to see two men fighting for their lives while Indian music is on full blast in the background. Is this indian John Wick? Also the soundtrack could have been more coherent, they used too many different genres.

Aside from that, it’s your classic action-revenge movie. Solid, but nothing groundbreaking. 6/10.
