Half of the film consists of sex scenes, while the other half features cinematic shots of Japanese cityscapes, all accompanied by wacky music that sounds like it came straight out of a generic Japanese visual novel. The only thing more absurd is the Fantozzi soundtrack. Impressively, the movie masters the art of including explicit sex scenes without ever showing any genitals. I enjoyed the performances, particularly the father and his synergy with his younger son. If youâ€™re looking for a compelling story, you should probably look elsewhere. However, the movie has surprisingly cute atmosphere. 6.5/10.
