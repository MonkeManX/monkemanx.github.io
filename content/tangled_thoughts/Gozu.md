This is the third movie I’ve watched by director Takashi Miike, the other two being [Ichi the Killer](/tangled_thoughts/ichi_the_killer/) and [Audition](/tangled_thoughts/audition/). And just like those two, this movie is very strange, though “strange” is an understatement. It’s easily weirder and more unsettling than both of them combined. It’s also the movie during which I most often audibly said, “What?”

I feel sorry for the protagonist: he gets a supposedly routine job from his boss, only to encounter the most bizarre things imaginable. At one point, it felt like he wasn’t even surprised anymore, just resigned.

If you want to watch something completely abnormal, full of moments that make you go “What?” and refuse to make any sense, then watch this. It’s exactly the kind of movie I love. **8/10.**
