> Its [Intellect] blessedness is not acquired; rather, everything is in it eternally, and it is true eternity, which time imitates, moving around it along with Soul, dropping some things and picking up others. 
>
> For at the level of Soul, thoughts are always changing; now it thinks of Socrates, now of a horse – always some particular being – whereas Intellect just is everything.
> 
> It has, then, all Beings stable in it, and it alone is, and the ‘is’ is always, and the future is nothing to it – for it ‘is’ then, too – nor is here a past for it – for nothing in the intelligible world has passed away – but all Beings are set within it always inasmuch as they are identical and in a way pleased to be in this condition.
