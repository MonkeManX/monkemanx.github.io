Like [last year](/tangled_thoughts/2024/) a short reflection on this year.


## Media

I included only media that I haven't mentioned elsewhere already.

- I read **32** proper books; the best one was *Why Buddhism Is True*.
- Movies of the year: *Angles Egg (1985)*, *Sirāt (2025)*, *Ichi the Killer (2001)* and *Lilya 4 Ever (2002)*.
- Song of the year: *Bloodline* by awakebutstillinbed.
- Album of the year: *what people call low self-esteem is really just seeing yourself the way other people see you* and *Windswept Adan*.
