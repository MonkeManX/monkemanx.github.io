I believe the only moral dimension of an action lies in its intention. In other words, every action and every outcome is morally neutral; only the intention is not.

The thoughts that led me to this theory are based on two things. First, I am a strong believer in Heidegger's concept of *Dasein*, that all purpose and meaning are dependent on human existence. This, leads to Sartre’s conclusion that if nothing has inherent objective meaning, then we ourselves give things meaning. Secondly, I believe in the Cynic, Buddhist, and Stoic principle that externals have no value. That is, we should be indifferent toward them. If we receive a new sports car as a gift, we can use it and even enjoy it, but if it is damaged or destroyed, we should not lament it.

From this, I conclude that because externals have no value, unintended consequences are not morally blameworthy. However, the individual still bears responsibility for the outcome. One might ask: if there is no moral responsibility, why should someone rectify their unintended consequences? My answer is that, as a society, we have created a framework of rules to which everyone who wants to be part of society must adhere. If someone violates that framework, they need to remedy the violation. Of course, they could choose not to do so—that is their choice—but then they cannot be part of society. All of this is rational and logical; it has no moral dimension.

Because outcomes have no moral dimension, and actions also do not (which seems entirely plausible, what would it even mean for them to have one? Where would it come from? Metaphysically, this seems strange), the only thing that remains is intention. And because of Heidegger’s *Dasein*- in which human existence is the origin of all meaning and, importantly, value-subjectivity itself carries a moral dimension. This is expressed through authenticity, which manifests in intention.
