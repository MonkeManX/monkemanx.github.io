> How, then, can you see the kind of beauty that a good soul has?  
> 
> Go back into yourself and look. If you do not yet see yourself as
beautiful, then be like a sculptor who, making a statue that is supposed to be beautiful, removes a part here and polishes a part there so that he makes the latter smooth and the former just right until he has given the statue a beautiful face. In the same way, you should remove superfluities and straighten things that are crooked, work on the things that are dark, making them bright, and not stop ‘working on your statue’ until the divine splendour of virtue shines in you, until you see ‘Self-Control enthroned on the holy seat’. [...]

>  If you see that you have become this, at that moment you have become sight. [...] Just open your eyes and see, for this alone is the eye that sees the great beauty. [...]
>
> For no eye has ever seen the sun without becoming sun-like, nor could a soul ever see Beauty without becoming beautiful. You must first actually become wholly god-like and wholly beautiful if you intend to see god and Beauty.

> ~ Plotinus, On Beauty
