Cool book. I do think it is a compelling account, particularly after reading books like *Analytical Analysis* and Sam Harris’s *Waking Up*, as well as papers like Nagel’s *What Is It Like to Be a Bat?* and the teletransport thought experiment from Parfit. My own empirical experience also backs up the idea that identity is not real: I very often don’t know why I do things or why I don’t, why I like certain things and not others, or why I act in a certain way, and so on.

I could probably write a lot about this book and the ideas in it, which I will do at a certain time later, when I try to put all the books I’ve read into one framework.

For now, I feel like the summary of the book in its appendix is adequate:

If you want it more academic, more casual, or more concise, I can adjust the tone easily.

1. Human beings often fail to see the world clearly, and this
can lead them to suffer and to make others suffer. is costly
misapprehension of the world can assume various forms,
described in various ways in different Buddhist texts. For
example:

2. Humans tend to anticipate more in the way of enduring
satisfaction from the attainment of goals than will in fact
transpire. is illusion, and the resulting mind-set of perpetual
aspiration, makes sense as a product of natural selection (see
chapter ), but it’s not exactly a recipe for lifelong happiness

3. Dukkha is a relentlessly recurring part of life as life is
ordinarily lived. is fact is less evident if you translate dukkha as
it’s conventionally translated—as “suffering” pure and simple—
than if you translate it as involving a big component of
“unsatisfactoriness.” Organisms, including humans, are designed
by natural selection to react to their environments in ways that
will make things “better” (in natural selection’s sense of the term).
is means they are almost always, at some level, scanning the
horizon for things to be unhappy about, uncomfortable with,
unsatisfied with. And since being unsatisfied, by definition,
involves at least a little suffering, thinking of dukkha as entailing
unsatisfactoriness winds up lending credence to the idea that
dukkha in the sense of suffering is a pervasive part of life. (See
chapters and .)

4. The source of dukkha identified in the Four Noble Truths—
tanha, translated as “thirst” or “craving” or “desire”—makes sense
against the backdrop of evolution. Tanha, you might say, is what
natural selection instilled in animals so they wouldn’t be satisfied
with anything for long (see chapter ). Seeing tanha as the source
of suffering makes even more sense when it is construed broadly,
as not only the desire to obtain and cling to pleasant things but
also the desire to escape from unpleasant things (see chapter ).
Clearly, if you took the suffering associated with feelings of
aversion out of the picture, that would take a lot of suffering out
of the picture.

5. The two basic feelings that sponsor dukkha—the two sides
of tanha, a clinging attraction to things and an aversion to
things—needn’t enslave us as they tend to do. Meditative
disciplines such as mindfulness meditation can weaken the grip
they exert. People disagree on whether complete and lasting
liberation—nirvana in the classic sense of the term—is attainable,
but there is no doubt that lives have been transformed by
meditative practice. It’s important to emphasize that becoming
less enslaved by craving and aversion doesn’t mean becoming
numb to feelings; it can mean developing a different relationship
to them and becoming more selective about which feelings to
most fully engage with. Indeed, this revised relationship can
include the accentuation of certain feelings, including wonder,
compassion, and the sense of beauty.

6. Our intuitive conception of the “self” is misleading at best.
We tend to uncritically embrace all kinds of thoughts and feelings
as “ours,” as part of us, when in fact that identification is optional.
Recognizing that the identification is optional and learning,
through meditation, how to make the identification less reflexive
can reduce suffering. An understanding of why natural selection
engineered various feelings into the human mind
can help validate the idea that we shouldn’t uncritically accept the
guidance of our feelings and can help us choose which feelings to
accept guidance from. To exercise this kind of discretion is to
follow a strictly pragmatic rendering of Buddhism’s famous “not-
self” idea—a rendering that is a plausible interpretation of the
foundational text on not-self, the second discourse the Buddha
delivered after his enlightenment.

7. The more expansive and more common interpretation of
the Buddha’s second discourse—as saying that the “self” simply
doesn’t exist—is rendered in various ways in various Buddhist
texts. A common rendering—that there is no CEO self, no self
that is the “doer of deeds,” the “thinker of thoughts”—is
substantially corroborated by modern psychology, which has
shown the conscious self to be much less in charge of our behavior
than it seems to be. A number of psychologists, including in
particular evolutionary psychologists, subscribe to a “modular”
model of the mind that is quite consistent with this view tha
there is no CEO self. is model can help explain a common
apprehension of advanced meditators: that “thoughts think
themselves.” All told, what I call the “interior” version of the not-
self experience—an experience that calls into question your
“ownership” of your thoughts and feelings and calls into question
the existence of the chief executive “you” that you normally think
of as owning these things—draws validation both from
experimental psychology and from prevailing ideas about how
natural selection shaped the mind.

8. What I call the “exterior” version of the not-self
experience—a sense that the bounds surrounding the self have
dissolved and were in some sense illusory to begin with—is not
empirically and theoretically corroborated in the same sense that,
I argue, the “interior” version of the not-self experience is
corroborated. Indeed, I’d say the exterior version is not in
principle amenable to corroboration in the same sense that the
interior version can be corroborated, because it amounts to a
claim that is less about psychology than about metaphysics (in the
sense of the term metaphysics used in mainstream philosophy,
not in any more exotic sense). At the same time, considerations
from evolutionary biology suggest a distinct sense in which the
bounds of the self can be thought of as arbitrary, which in turn
suggests that sensing a kind of dissolution of the bounds of the
self can be thought of as no less accurate an apprehension than
our ordinary sense of the bounds of the self.

9. Leaving aside the metaphysical validity of our ordinary
sense of self, and of alternatives to that ordinary sense of self,
there is the question of moral validity. In particular, when a sense
of the dissolution of the bounds of self (perhaps paired with the
“interior” version of the not-self experience in the form of
reduced identification with selfish impulses) leads to a less
pronounced prioritization of “my” interests over the interests of
others, does that move a person closer to moral truth? I argue that
considerations from evolutionary biology support an affirmative
answer to that question.

10. The intuition that objects and beings we perceive have
“essences” is, as the Buddhist doctrine of emptiness holds, an
illusion. Specifically, it is an illusion engineered by natural
selection to identify the significance of things with respect to the
Darwinian interests of the organisms doing the perceiving. is Darwinian defense of the idea of
emptiness is quite different from traditional Buddhist defenses of
the idea, but it’s compatible with them.) Seeing essences in things
doesn’t always lead us to suffer or to inflict suffering on others,
but it can. In particular, an “essentialist” view of other people and
groups of people can lead us to countenance or intentionally
cause their suffering.  So awareness that essence
is a perceptual construct, not a reality, can be valuable, especially
if paired with meditative practice that dampens the sense of
essence or permits selective engagement with it. Advanced
meditators who report having lost a sense of essence fairly
broadly—that is, who report apprehending emptiness or
formlessness in a fairly thoroughgoing way—seem to be very
happy and, in my (limited) experience, benevolent people.

11. The preceding point about essence and essentialism is one
illustration of the broader proposition that not seeing the world
clearly can lead not just to our own suffering but to bad conduct
in the sense of making others suffer needlessly. Or, to put a more
positive spin on it: Seeing the world more clearly can make you
not just happier but more moral. is isn’t a guaranteed outcome.
ere have been very good meditators who were (apparently) very
happy and (manifestly) very bad people. Still, there is a close
enough association between the psychological dynamics that
make us suffer and the psychological dynamics that make us
behave badly toward people that the Buddhist prescription for
lessening or ending suffering will tend to make us not just happier
but better people. at this moral progress isn’t guaranteed is one
reason meditative instruction has typically been paired with the
sort of ethical instruction that is so prominent in Buddhism.

12. Many Buddhist teachings, including several of those listed
here, could be lumped under the rubric of “awareness of
conditioning,” where “conditioning” means, roughly speaking,
causes. Mindfulness meditation involves increased attentiveness
to the things that cause our behavior—attentiveness to how
perceptions influence our internal states and how certain internal
states lead to other internal states and to behaviors. is
attentiveness includes an awareness of the critical role feelings
seem to play in these chains of influence—a role shaped by natural
selection, which seems to have calibrated feelings as part of its
programming of our brains. Importantly, the meditative practices
that bring awareness of these chains of influence also empower us
to intervene and change the patterns of influence. To a large
extent, that’s what Buddhist liberation is: a fairly literal escape
from chains of influence that had previously bound us and, often,
to which we had previously been blind.
So these are some of the main considerations that I hope
justify the title Why Buddhism Is True. But if you want the
shortest version of my answer to the question of why Buddhism
is true, it’s this: Because we are animals created by natural
selection. Natural selection built into our brains the tendencies
that early Buddhist thinkers did a pretty amazing job of sizing up,
given the meager scientific resources at their disposal. Now, in
light of the modern understanding of natural selection and the
modern understanding of the human brain that natural selection
produced, we can provide a new kind of defense of this sizing up.
