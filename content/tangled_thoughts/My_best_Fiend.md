This is a documentary directed by Werner Herzog about his friend and actor Klaus Kinski. If you want to learn more about Klaus Kinski, this is the right movie for you. I would definitely recommend watching at least a few Klaus Kinski movies before diving into this documentary. Some of my favorite anecdotes were:  

- During the last days of filming *Aguirre, the Wrath of God*, Kinski became so angry that he threatened to leave the set. He had already packed all his belongings. Upon hearing this, Herzog told him that he was free to leave, but warned that before he rounded the next corner, he would have eight bullets in his head from Herzog's rifle. Hearing this, Kinski became remarkably disciplined for the remainder of the shoot.  
- Another story Herzog shared involved his plan to raid Kinski's house and set it on fire. However, the plan was foiled because Kinski's shepherd dog was awake and alerted him.  

Definitely a 6.5/10.
