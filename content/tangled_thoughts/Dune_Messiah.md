***Dune Messiah*** is the second installment in the *Dune* series and a sequel to *Dune*. Many people dislike the book because Paul Atreides goes from being a hero in the first book to more of a villain, though I like that shift. The book’s theme—*that it’s dangerous to trust a single messianic leader who promises salvation*—is a timeless message, just as important today as it was in ancient times.  
Besides that, the novel itself is fun to read—many moving parts, people scheming against one another, complex dialogue, the occasional interesting poem or song, and great worldbuilding and lore.
