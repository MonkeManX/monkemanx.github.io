Very unique movie. How many movies or stories in general do you know that take place 80,000 years ago, when we humans were still “half-apes”? Such a unique concept: a tribe of early humans that doesn’t know how to make fire and for whom fire is holy. When their fire goes out, they have to go on a quest to find new fire for their tribe.

It has to be said that this story is fiction, who knows if it really happened like that, but it’s certainly fun to think this is how it might have happened. One way I like to think about the movie is as a journey showing how humans evolved: how different techniques are incorporated from other tribes, how new things are learned throughout the journey, and so on. **8/10**
