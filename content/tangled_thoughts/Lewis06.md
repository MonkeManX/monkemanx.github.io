> You will notice that we have got them completely fogged about the meaning of the word “real”.
> They tell each other, of some great spiritual experience,
> “All that really happened was that you heard some music in a lighted building”;
> here “Real” means the bare physical facts, separated from the other elements in the experience they actually had.
>
> On the other hand, they will also say
> “It’s all very well discussing that high dive as you sit here in an armchair, but wait till you get up there and see what it’s really like”:
> here “real” is being used in the opposite sense to mean, not the physical facts (which they know already while discussing the matter in armchairs)
> but the emotional effect those facts will have on a human consciousness.
>
> Either application of the word could be defended;
> but our business is to keep the two going at once
> so that the emotional value of the word “real” can be placed now on one side of the account,
> now on the other, as it happens to suit us.
>
> The general rule which we have now pretty well established among them is that
> in all experiences which can make them happier or better only the physical facts are “Real”
> while the spiritual elements are “subjective”;
> in all experiences which can discourage or corrupt them
> the spiritual elements are the main reality and to ignore them is to be an escapist.
>
> Thus in birth the blood and pain are “real”,
> the rejoicing a mere subjective point of view;
> in death, the terror and ugliness reveal what death “really means”.
>
> The hatefulness of a hated person is “real” —
> in hatred you see men as they are, you are disillusioned;
> but the loveliness of a loved person is merely a subjective haze
> concealing a “real” core of sexual appetite or economic association.
>
> Wars and poverty are “really” horrible;
> peace and plenty are mere physical facts about which men happen to have certain sentiments.
>
> The creatures are always accusing one another of wanting “to eat the cake and have it”;
> but thanks to our labours
> they are more often in the predicament of paying for the cake and not eating it.
