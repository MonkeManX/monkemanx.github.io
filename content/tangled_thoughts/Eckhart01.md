When meister Echhart said

> The eye through which I see God is the same eye through which God sees me; my eye and God's eye are one eye, one seeing, one knowing, one love.

What he meant can be understood through Bernardo Kastrup’s framework of Analytical Idealism:

> Humans, in particular, seem to be unique in our ability to think symbolically, conceptually. Other higher animals—such as cetaceans, pachyderms, apes, and perhaps even some mollusks—also seem to have some degree of self-awareness.
> If the four-billion-year-long evolutionary drama is pushing towards something, it seems to be these high-level mental functions.
> Now notice that it is only through these high-level functions that nature can take explicit notice of itself; raise its head above the tsunami of instinctual unfolding and take account of what it is doing; perhaps even of
> what it is. It is only through life—through dissociation—that nature can ‘step out of itself,’ so to contemplate itself with some degree of objectivity.
> As Jung put it, this meta-cognitive scrutiny is a second act of Creation, for it bathes existence with the light of a new level of awareness. There is a sense, thus, in which we are ‘spies for God.’ We are in the unique position, after the unfathomable labor of four billion years of evolution, to contemplate nature from a vantage point not otherwise
> available to nature. Countless conscious beings have lived and died over countless eons, so we could stand here today, musing about the most profound questions of existence. And after a lifetime of insights in this regard, upon death—the end of the dissociation—we contribute those insights to the broader field of cognition that nature is.
