Fun musical movie, perfect for the Christmas season. It looks gorgeous—stop-motion with a kind of puppetry and everything is extremely well made. Not just the set design, but the composition as well.

If there’s something deeper to say about it thematically, it might be a critique of reductionism: one can understand all the elements of a greater concept and still fail to grasp it, because sometimes the whole is more than the sum of its parts. **8/10**
