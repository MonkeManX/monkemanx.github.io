Personally, I disliked it. Instead of what I had hoped for, which was a philosophical exploration of the concept of nothing, it was mostly a physical explanation, or rather a history of ideas about what the vacuum is. I think the book [The Battle of the Big Bang](/tangled_thoughts/battle_of_big_bang/) does a better job at that than this one.

That said, if you’re interested in the history of scientific beliefs about “nothing,” this book might be for you.
