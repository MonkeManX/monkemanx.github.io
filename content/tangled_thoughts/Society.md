On an unrelated note, what's the deal with double seats on trains? If I'm sitting next to someone, and a two-seater nearby opens up, should I switch seats or stay put? Switching would make things more comfortable for everyone, but I don’t want the other person to think I moved because they smell or are somehow disgusting.
