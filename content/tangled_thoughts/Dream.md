I had a strange dream. I was at home with my mother, and another girl was there too. I don’t know exactly who the girl was or why she was living with us. However, I know that I had been teasing her from time to time, and we had a kind of friend-ish relationship. 

At one point, when I teased her, she didn’t respond. I thought it was unusual but decided to leave it alone. Later, when I came back and still didn’t get a response, I found her in the washroom. 

She was standing in a puddle of sodium washing powder, tears streaming down her face, trying to ignite the powder to kill herself. 

I asked her what was wrong, and she told me she had a sickness. She used the German word *“Verzerrung”* to describe it, which roughly means “consumption” — a disease where the body eats itself, leading to a slow and agonizing death with no cure. 

I hugged her and then sat down at the dinner table with my mother, thinking about what to do. 

I woke up - It was 4 AM.
