I had a strange dream. I was at home with my mother, and another girl was there too. I don’t know exactly who the girl was or why she was living with us. However, I know that I had been teasing her from time to time, and we had a kind of friend-ish relationship. 

At one point, when I teased her, she didn’t respond. I thought it was unusual but decided to leave it alone. Later, when I came back and still didn’t get a response, I found her in the washroom. 

She was standing in a puddle of sodium washing powder, tears streaming down her face, trying to ignite the powder to kill herself. 

I asked her what was wrong, and she told me she had a sickness. She used the German word *“Verzerrung”* to describe it, which roughly means “consumption” — a disease where the body eats itself, leading to a slow and agonizing death with no cure. 

I hugged her and then sat down at the dinner table with my mother, thinking about what to do. 

I woke up - It was 4 AM.

A while ago, I had a strange [dream], I will spare you details of it, but what was important that in this dream was girl. Who the girl was itself is not important, important is what she stands for. Or in other words, what I am insterested in is the value of her existance independent of mine conciousness.

Some people might frown and say something like "How can a imagined fiction of your mind exist independnet of your mind?"

But let's imagine in the future we build a device capable of extracting dreams and putting them in some kind of showbox, do we have moral obligation to the subjects in this dream? For example, if the same device is also capable to manipualte the dreams, would it be morally justfified to change the dream to a hellscape where the subjects in it eternally suffer, just for my amusement? If the subjects in it have intrinsic value then answer is obviosuly not. But do they have instrinsic value?
We can ask the same question even without this futuristic device, do we have a obligation to keep dreaming to continue the exitsance of the subejcts in it? Do we have the obligation to try to influence our dream for the betterment of the usbjects in it?

All of these question might seem silly, since characters from dreams surely aren't their own person or worht protecting? But this is exactly, what I want to investigate in this article.


One of the first argument can make against that the girl from the dream has value, is that she is not a living person and thus is not worh proecting. But I would argue that living is not a relevant factor, instead what we protect and ought to protect are the "continued conciouss experience" of a subject, for more on that you can look at my [previous article] on this in the context of arbortion.

If we go with this definition, we could still argue that girl from the dream does not have a "continued concious experience", thus still not worth proecting.

For this I again want to look at the following thought experiment, Imagine we are far in the furture and our computational capabilities are now so far devloped that we can simulate whole world with concious subjects in it (some might disagree taht tis even possible, but lets just assume it would be).

- simulated conciousness vs conciousness

Looking back at it, I wonder if waking up instead of continuining the dream (not like I had the choice) was an act of mercy. Because she, never had to experience her agonizing death, instead she just vanished out of existance.
But who am I, to say her life was not worth living? 

You might think it doesn't matter as she was just a fiction of my imagiation, to which I have several rebuttals. Who is to say, that you are not a fiction in the dreamlandscape called Universe, dreamt by a greater entity moore commonly referred as god.
You might argue, since she hasn't a body, thus not living
