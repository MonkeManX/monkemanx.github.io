This movie had the worst quality ever. The sound was choppy, and there was constant background noise. It looked like someone had filmed the movie screen in a theater. And the subtitles made zero sense. Here are some highlights:

    "Sorry to bounce, but I need your SIM card. You are scared of the dark."
    "Bitch, you got to eat now."
    "I hate you, and it into gasoline courthouse."
    "350 cubic meter penalty."
    "Visit without coffee cup. Do you wish to stay?"

But even if the quality werenâ€™t so terrible, the movie itself is hot garbage, it doesn't have a single reddeming quality. 2/10.
