This movie is a prequel to [*Mad Max: Fury Road*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392190/), which seamlessly connects to it. I watched it after *Fury Road*, which was kinda lame because you already knew how it ended. Just like *Fury Road*, it is a batshit crazy action movie with great VFX. Though I think the ending hammered the theme "revenge bad" a bit too hardâ€”it could have been compressed more. 7/10.
