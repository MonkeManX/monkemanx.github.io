I liked the movie; the set design was impressive, and Marcus Aurelius was properly portrayed as a stoic. I also loved his death speech.  

Thematically, the movie is well done. It highlights the stoic ideals of Marcus Aurelius, particularly his virtues of duty and responsibility above everything else, even in the face of immense suffering. These ideals clash with more worldly desires, as seen in his son Commodus, who acts like a serpent, seducing others away from virtue. This conflict is also reflected in the struggle against the barbarians. A recurring phrase, *"I am not as strong as I thought I was,"* encapsulates this theme well. 7.5/10.
