*Meditations* by Marcus Aurelius, along with Senecaâ€™s *Letters* and Epictetus' *Discourses*, is one of the three major Stoic works that have survived to our time. Of the three, I like it the least. It is less rigorous than Epictetus and less practical than Seneca. It is written in a more flowery and poetic style, with themes often repeating themselves, and the verses are not always interconnected.  
I would recommend reading a version that provides more explanations of the verses rather than the Reclam edition, which only offers footnotes. If you're starting with Stoicism, begin with Epictetus' *Discourses*.
