[Suki-Suki Daisuki](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/%E6%88%B8%E5%B7%9D%E7%B4%94/%E5%A5%BD%E3%81%8D%E5%A5%BD%E3%81%8D%E5%A4%A7%E5%A5%BD%E3%81%8D/) by *Jun Togawa* is a Japanese new wave synth-pop album. It heavily utilizes synthesizers for instrumentation, but the vocals are definitely the highlight—she does a lot with her voice. In comparison, the instruments are more subdued.  

The album is meant to be a satirical take on the Japanese idol scene, making it an acquired taste. She does sound a bit like Houshou Marine; both are Japanese and hags—coincidence? I don’t think so.
