This is the second book in the Discworld series. It picks up directly after the first one. Although it's not required to know the first book, it's probably better if you do.

I liked it â€” as always, a hilarious concept, interesting characters, and a cute story. Although the story is more of a playground for the characters to interact with each other.

Poor Rincewind, never getting any rest.
