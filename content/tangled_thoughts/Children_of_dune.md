***Children of Dune*** is the third installment in the *Dune* series and a sequel to *Dune Messiah*. It’s a fun book to read—I liked the direction it took, especially the final confrontation where all the characters meet up. Though I read the book a bit hastily, I think reading it more carefully would have given the dialogue and poetry much more meaning. Certain chapters were a bit boring, but that’s the nature of novels with multiple character points of view. Sometimes, you end up reading about a character in a situation you like less and just keep thinking, *"When are we going back to the interesting points of view?"*  
Besides that, I loved what they did with the Preacher figure. I wonder if the author drew inspiration from Jesus for that character?
