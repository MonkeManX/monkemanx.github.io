The story and setting are poorly written and cringe-worthy. For example, near the end, there is a 10-minute exposition dump that, if removed, wouldn’t change anything. Or the neckbeard Reddit warrior who idolizes Elon Musk (which didn’t age very well) and has as many conspiracies as grains of sand on the beach ends up saving the world—how great!
You watch the movie for one purpose only: the VFX, which are spectacular. 5/10.
