{{< thought_image image="/attachments/sirat.jpg" >}}

Very Dionysian, as Nietzsche would say.

This reminds me so much of my [Namibia Trip](/articles/namibia/): the jeeps packed full with provisions and equipment, driving through small rivers, over mountains, being in the middle of the desert, getting towed by another car; the view; the worry about whether you packed enough food and drinks; and also getting stuck in the middle of nowhere because your wheel spins itself deeper and deeper into the ground.

And the movie is always accompanied by the rhythmic waves of electronics, trying to hypnotize you. **?/10**.
