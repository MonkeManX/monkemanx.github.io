A group of schoolgirls accidentally poisons their local brass band and has to step in as replacements. The catch? Most of them can’t play any instruments, and the few who can have instruments that don’t mix well together. So, they decide to form a [big band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_band) and play swing instead.  

The vibes in this movie are immaculate. I absolutely love the humor. It also features some really great jazz, especially in the last 10 minutes, where my ears ate very well. 7.5/10.
