Has one of the greatest opening hooks I’ve ever seen in a movie. Also, the scene with the criminals lining up for the victim to identify them; I recognized the reference from *Family Guy*. I love the self-narration style, similar to what you see in *Casino* — it’s a really cool stylistic tool. Great movie overall. 8/10.
