This is a selection of various media, I particularly enjoyed or found interesting enough to highlight here.

## Movies 


{{< media "/attachments/synnedoch_new_york.jpg" "Synecdoche in New York" "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383028/" >}}
A surrealist movie with the central theme of identity, it branches out to explore various other topics such as love, living, death, and the decisions one makes or doesn't make. It's an awesome movie, though it's not easy to understand and requires active participation to be fully enjoyed.

{{< media "/attachments/beu_is_afraid.jpg" "Beu is Afraid" "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13521006/" >}}
Another surrealist movie centered around Beau, like the name of the movie implies the protagonist who is afraid of everything. It explores themes of guilt, cowardice, family trauma, and the modern way of life. It's another movie I really like, though with its running time of 3 hours, it can be a bit long.

{{< media "/attachments/doctor_strange_love.jpg" "Doctor Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/" >}}
It is a black comedy that satirizes the threat of nuclear destruction during the Cold War. It criticizes the dogma of mutual assured destruction. The movie is not too long and very fun, with the only potentially off-putting aspect being that it is in black and white.

{{< media "/attachments/lola_runs.jpg" "Run Lola Run" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_Lola_Run" >}}
A little bit of representation for German movie making. It's a very chaotic movie which is a lot of fun, the main theme the movie explores is the topic of free will and how small encounters or actions can shape one's life in the most unforeseen consequences. But the movie doesn't say "You have no control of your life", instead it shows that through your own actions you can succeed.

{{< media "/attachments/house_1977.jpg" "House (1977)" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_(1977_film)" >}}
A Japanese comedy-horror movie that’s really weird but cool. It’s about a group of high school girls who go together to a house in the countryside, where strange things start to happen.
{{< /media >}}

## TV-Shows


{{< media "/attachments/legion_show.jpg" "Legion" "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5114356/" >}}
Legion follows the story of David, a man diagnosed with schizophrenia who has spent much of his life institutionalized. As the series unfolds, David starts to question if there might be more to his condition than just illness. While Legion may not be the most coherent or straightforward show (it is rather surreal at times), it stands out for its creativity, unique storytelling, visual style, and Aubrey Plaza's performance. Later seasons are worse then the earlier ones.

## Anime

{{< media "/attachments/Hinamatsuri.jpg" "Hinamatsuri" "https://myanimelist.net/anime/36296/Hinamatsuri" >}}
A hilarious slice-of-life anime that is also incredibly cute. It’s about a yakuza who, through surreal circumstances, suddenly becomes the caregiver of a girl, leading to their wacky adventures.
{{< /media >}}


## Books 


{{< media "/attachments/The_Things_They_Carried.jpg" "The Thing They Carried" "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/133518.The_Things_They_Carried" >}}
So often, one hears sad stories, such as people dying in war. But our emotional reaction to such events is often negligible. This book, instead of trying to tell us the real truth, conveys story truth, capturing the emotion of the narrative. It is a collection of beautifully connected short stories.
{{< /media >}}


{{< media "/attachments/notes_from_underground.jpg" "Notes from Underground" "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49455.Notes_from_Underground" >}}
A Russian novel, it is seperated into two parts the first part deals with the protagonist thoughts and philosophical outlook and are written as a monologue. The second part is a more regular story, which shows the consequences of the protagonist philosophical outlook. Though I like the book, it's hard to recommend, the first part is mostly an repsonse to occurrent philosophical theory at that date (e.g. determinism, rational egoism, nihilism and utopianism) and without the background hard to read, the second part is much more understable though. I think it gives an important lesson of what not to become.

{{< media "/attachments/possums_book.jpg" "Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats" "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/402128.Old_Possum_s_Book_of_Practical_Cats" >}}
It's a collection of silly poems about cats. Fun to read.
{{< /media >}}

## Short stories/Fables 

{{< media "/attachments/IHaveNoMouth.jpg" "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream" "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/415459.I_Have_No_Mouth_I_Must_Scream" >}}
Is about technological misuse and the human resilience in the face of existential horror.
{{< /media >}}


{{< media "/attachments/lastquestion.jpg" "The Last Question" "https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~gamvrosi/thelastq.html" >}}
Explores the limits of scientific advancement and knowledge. 
{{< /media >}}


{{< media "/attachments/dragon_tyrant.jpg" "The Fable of the Dragon Tyrant" "https://nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon" >}}
A Story about Death.
{{< /media >}}


{{< media "/attachments/emerald_circus.jpg" "'The Bird' from Emerald Circus" "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34218720-the-emerald-circus" >}}
Beautiful story.
{{< /media >}}


## Webserials

{{< media "/attachments/ISSTH.jpg" "I shall seal the Heaven" "https://www.novelupdates.com/series/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/" >}}
This was the first Xianxia novel I ever read, and as such, it is dear to my heart. It is a solid book that made me shed a tear at one part, with classic Xianxia tropes, perfect for people without experience with the genre.
{{< /media >}}

{{< media "/attachments/reverend_insanity.jpg" "Reverend Insanity" "https://www.novelupdates.com/series/reverend-insanity/" >}}
Another Xianxia book, it is famous for its ruthless protagonist and great story. If one has read enough Xianxia, it is a great story that subverts the classical Xianxia tropes. What I like most about the story are the "Legends of Ren Zu" interspersed throughout the novel, which tell the creation myth of the novel's world. One last thing to keep in mind is that the book wasn't finished due to it being banned for being too critical of the Chinese government.
{{< /media >}}


{{< media "/attachments/Lord-of-the-Mysteries.jpeg" "Lord of Mysteries" "https://www.novelupdates.com/series/lord-of-the-mysteries/" >}}
To get the negatives out of the way, it's a slow story that only starts to ramp up after 200 chapters. Although the characters are fun, they are not meaningfully deep. Now for the positives: the story is good, and the world-building in this novel is among the best I've read.
{{< /media >}}


{{< media "/attachments/Katalepsis.jpg" "Katalepsis" "https://katalepsis.net/" >}}
A great story about a girl who is constantly plagued by horrifying visions and her quest to uncover the truth behind them. It is a cosmic Lovecraftian horror novel with great characters and a compelling story, though it involves a lot of lesbian sex and character drama.
{{< /media >}}


{{< media "/attachments/Necroepilogos.jpg" "Necroepilogos" "https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/59967/necroepilogos" >}}
From the same author of Katalepsis, this time it's an amazing post-apocalyptic sci-fi story. The world-building is deep and rich, and each character is unique, with understandable motives for their actions and well-developed character arcs.
{{< /media >}}


{{< media "/attachments/beware_of_chicken.jpg" "Beware of the Chicken" "https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39408/beware-of-chicken" >}}
Another web-serial that subverts the classical Xianxia tropes, where our protagonist decides against defying the heavens and pursuing cultivation for greater heights. Instead, he chooses to become a simple farmer and make the most out of his life. It's a wholesome slice-of-life story that warms one's heart.

## Music Albums

{{< media "/attachments/kagayaki.jpg" "Aratamemashite Hajimemashite Midori Desu" "https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/%E9%AB%98%E6%9C%A8%E6%AD%A3%E5%8B%9D/%E3%81%8B%E3%81%8C%E3%82%84%E3%81%8D-kagayaki/">}}
Kagayaki is an album by Masakatsu Takagi and another great Japanese album (Boy, do I love the japs). This time, it leans toward folk music. The coolest thing about this album is its sheer diversity: we have instrumental tracks, songs, tracks with spoken word similar to Slint, and lots of unique sounds. It’s a relaxing album, like a warm hug.
{{< /media >}}

{{< /media >}}

{{< media "/attachments/the_seer.jpg" "The Seer" "https://www.last.fm/music/Swans/The+Seer">}}

{{< /media >}}

{{< /media >}}

{{< media "/attachments/nubes_de_alcohol.jpg" "Nubes de Alcohol" "https://www.last.fm/music/Mujercitas+Terror/Nubes+de+Alcohol">}}
Created by the Argentine band "Mujercitas Terror," this is a rock/post-punk album. It's very cool to hear a Latin American represented in this space. The album has a length of 23 minutes, containing 3 tracks.
{{< /media >}}

{{< media "/attachments/en_el_radio.webp" "Perdidxs en el Ruido" "https://www.last.fm/music/Las+Olas+(Noispop)/Perdidxs+en+el+Ruido">}}
Created by the Chilean band "Las Olas (Noispop)," this is a post-punk, noise-pop album. I can't speak to the lyrics, but from the sound, they are criminally underrated. The album has a length of 27 minutes and contains 10 tracks.

## Philosophy Stuff

{{< media "/attachments/free_will.jpg" "Free Will" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Will_(book)">}}
Cool book by Sam Harris, arguing that free will is an illusion.
{{< /media >}}

{{< media "/attachments/metaethics_an_introduction.jpg" "Metaethics: An Introduction" "https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Andrew-Fisher/dp/1844652580">}}
A very readable introduction to metaethics, not too long, suitable even for laypeople, that covers the most important branches of the field. However, it is not a complete account, as it does not, for example, include 'response-dependence theories' or 'constructivism.
{{< /media >}}

{{< media "/attachments/knowledge_introduction.jpg" "Knowledge: A Very Short Introduction" "https://academic.oup.com/book/461">}}
An introduction to epistemology and the theory of knowledge, it is roughly 150 pages long and covers topics such as rationalism, empiricism, skepticism, justified true belief, Gettier problems, and much more. It includes numerous examples, most of which are highly illustrative.
{{< /media >}}

{{< media "/attachments/cambridge_aristotele_ethics.jpg" "Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics: An Introduction" "https://www.cambridge.org/de/universitypress/subjects/philosophy/classical-philosophy/aristotles-nicomachean-ethics-introduction?format=HB&isbn=9780521817424">}}
A thorough analysis of the Nicomachean Ethics, one of the first works that attempts to lay out a philosophical theory based on first principles. At times, it felt a bit lengthy to me, and I would have preferred a more condensed version. This is because the author not only presents his interpretations of the passages but also explores alternative interpretations, weighing them against each other. The conclusion was also a bit wishy-washy. If one wants to delve deeply into Aristotle's ethics, I highly recommend it; otherwise, perhaps not as much.
