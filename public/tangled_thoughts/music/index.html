  <h1> Music </h1>
  <p class="pub-date">Published: October 5, 2024</p>
  
  <p>I just watched the greatest live music performance I&rsquo;ve ever seen. It was full of energy, just incredible. There were many funny moments, to name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>Halfway through the video, I realized the drummer was only wearing his underwear. In contrast, the bass player was dressed in a full suit with a blazer, while the singer was wearing a school uniform and the piano player wore an orange work uniform. That contrast, lol.</li>
<li>The singer had only one sock on, the other was mysteriously missing.</li>
<li>At one point, the singer began walking on people&rsquo;s heads in the crowd while singing.</li>
<li>Randomly, after one song, the drummer and singer got into a screaming match.</li>
<li>The singer also punched the microphone against an amplifier.</li>
<li>The piano player left his spot in the middle of the stage to show off some dance moves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Watch it, it&rsquo;s worth it!</p>
