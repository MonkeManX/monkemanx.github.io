  <h1> My Homelab Part 0: Prologue </h1>
  <p class="pub-date">Published: December 16, 2023</p>
  
  <p>Lately, maintaining a consistent sleeping schedule has posed big challenge for me.
Different university courses have lead me to wake up on some days as early as 6 a.m., while on other days, I&rsquo;ve found myself rising as late as 12. p.m .
This irregular sleeping schedule has been quite a struggle, especially on days where I had to get up early.
My body, accustomed to my late-night schedule, could never fall asleep soon enough for a well-rested morning.</p>

<p>Thus I decided to establish a more consistent sleep schedule by waking up early on every weekday.
The big question was how could I make this happen?</p>
<p>The solution I arrived at consisted of three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shutting down my computer early</li>
<li>A phone free bedroom</li>
<li>Light as Sleep-Wake Signal</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="early-shutdown-of-computer">Early Shutdown of Computer</h2>
<p>I often caught myself watching YouTube videos after YouTube video late into the night, even when I knew that I should have gone to bed long ago.
In an attempt to stop this behavior, I came up with the idea of automatically shutting down my computer on a schedule.</p>
<p>Implementing this was straightforward.
Given that I use Linux(Debian 12) as operating system for my Computer, I could use use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a> to automatically shutdown my computer on a specified schedule.</p>
<p>To achieve this, I first needed to edit the crontab file - the crontab file is a configuration file that is responsible for storing all the scheduled jobs the cron daemon executes.
Users have the option to use their own crontab file or utilize the system-wide crontab file.</p>
<p>To access and edit the crontab file, the following command is used:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">sudo crontab -e
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The usage of <code>sudo</code> is particularly noteworthy. This grants the necessary privileges to edit the crontab file of the root user. Omitting the <code>sudo</code> would mean editing the crontab file of the current user. This is important because the shutdown commands requires sudo privileges for execution.</p>
<p>Upon executing the above command, users can then input the desired command to be executed to a specific schedule, following the syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl"># ┌───────────── minute (0–59)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl"># │ ┌───────────── hour (0–23)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl"># │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1–31)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">4</span><span class="cl"># │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1–12)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">5</span><span class="cl"># │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0–6) (Sunday to Saturday;
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">6</span><span class="cl"># │ │ │ │ │                                   7 is also Sunday on some systems)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">7</span><span class="cl"># │ │ │ │ │
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">8</span><span class="cl"># │ │ │ │ │
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">9</span><span class="cl"># * * * * * &lt;command to execute&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>To ensure correctness in the syntax, a helpful tool is is <a href="https://crontab.guru/">grontab guru</a>.
This tool enables users to validate the syntax and show its semantic meaning.</p>
<p>For my particularly use case, I inserted the following line into the crontab file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl"><span class="m">45</span> <span class="m">21</span> * * 0-4 systemctl shutdown
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This command will shutdown my computer on 21:45 on every day of the week from Sunday to Thursday.
This should work on all Linux operating systems that use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd">Systemd</a> such as fedora, debian, ubuntu, arc and ect.</p>

<h2 id="a-phone-free-bedroom">A phone free bedroom</h2>
<p>Implementing a phone-free bedroom has brought another very positive change in my routine.
Previously, I found myself often glued to the screen for long period of times.</p>
<p>To establish the habit of removing my phone from my sleeping space, I followed roughly <a href="https://jamesclear.com/">James Clear&rsquo;s</a> habit formation list, as outlined in his his book <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a>, which emphasizes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make it obvious</strong>:  Create cues for your habit.</li>
<li><strong>Make it attractive</strong>: Utilize habit bundling.</li>
<li><strong>Make it easy</strong>:  Reduce friction.</li>
<li><strong>Make it Satisfying</strong>:  Use positive reinforcement.</li>
</ul>
<p>I relocated my phone charger to the power plug next to my toothbrush.
This simple act had multiple effect. Spotting the charger when I brush my teeth serve as a reminder to charge my phone and leave it out the bedroom - thereby <em>making it obvious</em>.
Additionally, by combining the habit of leaving my phone outside of the room with brushing teeth, <em>I make it attractive and easy</em>.</p>
<p>A last aspect that I want to mention is that of the alarm clock. Like most people, I used my phone as an alarm clock. To gain independence from that I bought a cheap digital alarm clock.</p>
<h2 id="light-as-sleep-wake-signal">Light as Sleep-Wake Signal</h2>
<p>Light plays a vital role in regulating our body&rsquo;s  circadian rhythm, the natural 24-hour cycle that governs our sleep-wake patterns.
For more on this check out the awesome book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/37534452">Circadian code by Satchin Panda</a>.
By simulating natural light of sunrise and sunset, we can signal our bodies when it time to wake up and when its time to fall asleep.</p>
<p>Initially, I considered about buying a daylight alarm clock capable of mimicking the light of sunrise and sunset.
However good options like the Philips HF3531 or Lumie Bodyclocks were outside of my price range.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where smart lighting solution like smart lamps come into play.
This option is not only affordable but combined with a central server which runs <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> maximal flexible.</p>
<p>In the blog entries in the series &ldquo;My Homelab&rdquo;, I want to write about how I exactly set up my server, Home Assistant and smart lightning.</p>

<p>(I really feel like I ignored the bigger issue, and procrastinated by creating this whole elaborated setup, well you will see what I mean in the following posts :P)</p>
