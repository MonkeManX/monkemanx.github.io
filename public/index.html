  <h1> Notes from the Wired</h1>
    <p>
    This is a website where I write articles on various topics that interest me, carving out a bit of cyberspace for myself.<br><br>
You shouldn't believe anything I talk about â€”- I use words entirely recreationally.

          An Introduction to the Theory of Cellular Automata
      </a>
       Info This article is based on a lecture at my university. It does not cover all topics from the lecture. Furthermore, since the original lecture was in German, the definitions have been translated into English and may sound a bit awkward.
1. Basic of Cellular Automata 1.1 What are Cellular Automata You might have heard of Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life, though calling it a &ldquo;game&rdquo; is somewhat misleading &ndash; it is more accurately described as a simulation. The Game of Life models the process of life on a grid of arbitrary size, where each square, or &ldquo;tile,&rdquo; can either be colored (alive) or uncolored (dead). The initial pattern of living cells can be set manually or randomized. From there, the simulation follows a set of simple rules that determine whether each cell will live, die, or remain unchanged in the next generation. The process repeats step by step until the user decides to stop it.

      Thinking about the time when a local drug lord is killed in the show Xavier: Renegade Angel, and just before he dies, he makes a profession of faith in an attempt to escape hell and go to heaven.
Your browser does not support this embedded video. One thing to note is that among the major Christian denominations (Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant), this might only be possible in Protestant theology because of the Five Solas, which emphasize &ldquo;by faith alone&rdquo; and &ldquo;by grace alone&rdquo; (meaning salvation is not dependent on personal merit but solely on your faith and the grace of god). However, there is debate over what is included or necessary in &ldquo;faith&rdquo; and &ldquo;grace.&rdquo;
