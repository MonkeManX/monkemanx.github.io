      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;preliminary&#34;&gt;Preliminary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was in elementary school, I attended a school that ran all day. After each lesson, we had short breaks, along with three longer breaks: one in the morning, one at lunchtime, and another in the afternoon. The morning breaks are the most memorable for me. During these breaks, the entire school was sent out to the schoolyard, and no one was allowed inside, unlike the other breaks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
