      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, maintaining a consistent sleeping schedule has posed big challenge for me.&#xA;Different university courses have lead me to wake up on some days as early as 6 a.m., while on other days, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself rising as late as 12. p.m .&#xA;This irregular sleeping schedule has been quite a struggle, especially on days where I had to get up early.&#xA;My body, accustomed to my late-night schedule, could never fall asleep soon enough for a well-rested morning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
